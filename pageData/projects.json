I wanted to make sure their cats had space to get fresh air and get away from each other if needed (as they blended their cat families) —and I love woodworking, so I decided to build a catio for them.",

If I did it over again, I would use a smaller mesh, but so far it's been keeping the cats in and whatever else out.  (I read that 16 gauge was recommended to make sure cats can’t break the wire with claws or teeth)."
