(Note - Arthur is good with electricity, so it was easy enough for him to disconnect and reconnect the lights while we worked, but I myself, wouldn't attempt the lights alone)."

Ship lap had a very similar look to tongue and groove, but was actually much cheaper and easier to work with (except for the fact that we were working with much longer heavier boards when we did ship lap). My contractor also recommended that we randomly vary the length of the starting board in each row use 'quarter round' to finish the edges, so that's what we did."

PRO TIP - All boards must be cut such that they start and end at a ceiling joist (otheriwse the ends will droop)!"
