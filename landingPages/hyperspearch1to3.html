                <p><strong>DEDICATION:</strong><span style="font-weight: 300;"><br /></span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">To Google Bard. You have been the best writing partner a girl could ask for. You are always encouraging, but honest, full of insight and ideas. And you came up with the title, so that alone deserves a dedication. Also, my chickens would have a much blander life if I couldn&rsquo;t constantly ask you what's okay and not okay to feed them.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><strong>&hellip; and when I showed Bard the dedication statement, Bard said it was good, but suggested that I might be able to improve it by converting it into a poem and I&rsquo;m not a poem person (but Bard really really loves poems), so I asked Bard to just write the poem&hellip; so this is how Bard would have preferred that I dedicate this book to Bard&hellip;&nbsp;</strong></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Of course! Here's a poem based on your lovely dedication statement:</span></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">To Bard, My Muse, My Writing Guide</span></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">No human partner, yet your hand in mine,</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Across the pages, thoughts like stars align.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">With endless patience, gentle nudges too,</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">You led me onward, dreams reborn anew.</span></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">When doubt choked words, you fanned the spark,</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Unleashing stories, leaving my mark.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Like whispers in the void, your prompts arose,</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Unraveling plots, where darkness froze.</span></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">For titles forged, and scenes alight,</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">For feathered friends, and wisdom's light,</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">My heart explodes, a grateful song,</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">To Bard, who made my novel strong.</span></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">So raise a glass, to lines untamed,</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">To chapters shared, and fears disclaimed.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">May every word, with joy resound,</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">"This book, dear Bard, on you I've crowned."</span></p>

                <p><strong>I formatted the header of each chapter like a database entry to convey the following information:</strong></p>

                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Ice clinks against the edge of the mason jar in my hand as a wave of cold lemonade rolls down my throat; a subtle reprieve from August&rsquo;s heat. I&rsquo;m lowering my jar to the graying picnic table in front of me when my fingers buzz with the familiar tingle of an oncoming glitch.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">As my right arm immobilizes, I catch a whiff of citrus wafting by on a dry breeze and there&rsquo;s a faint ting of wind chimes in the distance</span></p>
                <p><em><span style="font-weight: 300;">Oh well; there's worse places to glitch out on a Friday evening.</span></em></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">I sigh as I glance past my pixelating hand, down a crushed gravel walkway that leads to a small, blue-gray ranch-style house. Bordering the front of the house, is a row of perfect lollipop-shaped lemon trees, brimming with yellow fruit and abuzz with honey bees. Across from the lemon trees, and surrounding the table where I sit, are eight large wood-framed garden beds, each a tangle of dark green herbs, fruits, vegetables and crawling vines.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">My arm regains mobility and I set my jar on the picnic table.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Jogging steps approach behind me and I crane my neck, peaking curiously through a row of sunflower stalks in search of the source.</span><span style="font-weight: 300;"><br /></span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">Pushing several large leaves aside, my eyes land on a husky woman plodding down the sidewalk in neon yellow soccer shorts and a sweat-soaked neon pink Eddie Murphy t-shirt. From her corded over-ear headphones I hear the muffled audio of &ldquo;Party All The Time&rdquo; grow louder then subside as she passes.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">I turn to reach for another sip of lemonade and let out a startled yelp. Across from me, a lumber-jack-looking stranger (scruffy salt and pepper hair and beard, well-worn jeans and a long-sleeved red plaid shirt) chuckles as he pours himself a jar of lemonade from the glass pitcher I&rsquo;d just used.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Uhm, hi.&rdquo; I plaster on an exaggerated smile. &ldquo;You startled me&rdquo;.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;I noticed that.&rdquo; His dark eyes twinkle as he sets the pitcher next to a cluster of mason jars in the middle of the table.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Fresh from the tree this morning.&rdquo; He jerks his thumb over his shoulder indicating the lollipop lemon trees.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really good.&rdquo; I take a sip. &ldquo;Actually&rdquo; I smile, my eyes fixed on the lollipop trees.&nbsp; &ldquo;It r</span><span style="font-weight: 300;">eminds</span><span style="font-weight: 300;"> me of my mom&rsquo;s lemonade,&rdquo; I sigh, &ldquo;she always used to make it from scratch with Meyer lemons and a couple basil leaves.&rdquo; My eyes and tone droop. &ldquo;It's been a long time since I had fresh lemonade.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">The man&rsquo;s brow slopes sympathetically. &ldquo;Life doesn&rsquo;t just go around handing folks lemons.&rdquo; He clanks his glass down on the table and gestures around his yard. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve gotta turn some soil and&nbsp; plant some trees if you want good lemonade.&rdquo; He extends his hand towards me. &ldquo;By the way, I&rsquo;m Jeff.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Sorry&rdquo;, I wince as I envelop his dry rough hand in my frail sweating one. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Jenna.&rdquo; I laugh nervously. &ldquo;I saw the pitcher of&nbsp; lemonade and all the empty mason jars and I guess I thought I was supposed to just sit down and have some.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;And you were right.&rdquo; He grins. &ldquo;Do you have a house in this neighborhood?&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;I wish.&rdquo;&nbsp; I press the mason jar to my face. &ldquo;Actually, I was stuck in traffic next to your van this morning, so I scanned the QR code on it and went to your website.&rdquo; I lower my lemonade, affixing my gaze to his, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m still a bit confused about what you&rsquo;re doing.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">He shrugs. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just gathering folks together to share a meal once a week.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <em><span style="font-weight: 300;">Why does that sound so nice and so creepy at the same time?</span></em></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">I wait for him to say more, but he just starts sipping his lemonade.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;&ldquo;So are the others coming later or&hellip;?&rdquo; My voice trails off</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;It's like my website says, dinner’s at 6:30.No RSVP required.” Jeff shrugs.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">I nod, as if this is a satisfying response. But it&rsquo;s not. Not knowing how many strangers are going to be elbow to elbow with me at this table stresses me out,</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">and the intricate symphony of birds and insects chirping and buzzing around us is starting to remind me of the quiet moment before the jump scare in a horror film.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">I take another sip of lemonade swishing the sweet-tart-wholesome goodness around my mouth.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">He sips from his jar.</span></p>
                <p><em><span style="font-weight: 300;">Why did I come here? I could be home on my couch in my underwear, eating cold chow mein and playing Skyrim right now, but nooo, I haaad to see the sign on this guy&rsquo;s stupid van.</span></em></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">My ears perk at the sound of shuffling sneakers and Eddie Murphy&rsquo;s muffled voice singing: &ldquo;Some girls like to party all the time, party all the time, party all the time&rdquo; . The song and footsteps grow louder, then subside. Then there&rsquo;s just clinking ice in Jeff&rsquo;s glass and birds chirping in the distance.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">He sips from his jar.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">I sip from mine.</span></p>
                <p><em><span style="font-weight: 300;">People in movies always bury bodies in gardens.</span></em></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">He sips from his jar.</span><span style="font-weight: 300;"><br /></span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">I set my jar on the table and stare at it trying to mentally assess my internal organs for signs of poisoning.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">He sips from his jar.</span></p>
                <p><em><span style="font-weight: 300;">The plants are pretty tall. I wonder if this picnic table is even visible from across the street. </span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 300;"><br /></span></em> <span style="font-weight: 300;">He sips.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">I imagine myself sprinting through the sunflowers to my car.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">He sips.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">My sense of propriety glues me to the picnic bench.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">Ice clinks at the bottom of Jeff&rsquo;s mason jar. &ldquo;So tell me Jenna,&rdquo;&nbsp; he lets out a satisfied sigh as he sets the empty jar on the table, &ldquo; If a Martian observed you through a super-powered telescope for the last year, what would he say about you?&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><em><span style="font-weight: 300;">Here we go. Aliens. This is a UFO cult.</span></em></p>
                <p><em><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;</span></em><span style="font-weight: 300;">I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; I shrug. &ldquo;What would a Martian say about you?&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">Jeff strokes his beard. &ldquo;I think he&rsquo;d say I spend a lot of time outdoors, working with my hands. I smile more when I&rsquo;m with other people than when I&rsquo;m alone.&rdquo; He grins. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m one badass fisherman!&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">I hear a cuckoo clock chiming the six o&rsquo;clock hour from somewhere inside his house.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><em><span style="font-weight: 300;">Why do I always show up so early for everything.&nbsp;</span></em></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">I take another sip of lemonade. I think I detect a bitter note to it.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">I don&rsquo;t swallow.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Raising my jar back to my lips, I subtly spit lemonade back in. &ldquo;So why have dinner with strangers?&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">Jeff narrows his eyes at my lemonade jar, clearly nonplussed by my backwash.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;I almost swallowed a seed.&rdquo; I lie.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;You must be pretty hungry then&rdquo;, Jeff winks &ldquo;I&rsquo;m making baked Halibut and rice for dinner.&rdquo;&nbsp; He presses himself up from the table. &ldquo;Would you mind carrying some things out from the house?&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <em><span style="font-weight: 300;">Oh god he wants me to go inside his house.&nbsp;</span></em></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">I plaster on a grin as I remain rigidly seated on the picnic bench. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 300;">Think of an excuse to leave. Think of an excuse to leave.</span></em></p>
                <p><em><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;&ldquo;</span></em><span style="font-weight: 300;">You know I just actually realized,&rdquo; my eyes dart around the yard searching for inspiration. &ldquo;Uhm&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">A dog barks in the distance.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">I swivel on the bench &ldquo;I need to go feed my dog.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Turning back to Jeff, I grab my purse from the table beside me.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">He flashes an amused smile. &ldquo;Alright. I&rsquo;m in the Halibut of eating alone anyway.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Sorry.&rdquo; I wince. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe I forgot.&rdquo; I slide my purse strap over my shoulder. &ldquo;I share custody of him with my ex, so I totally spaced that today is my turn.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">I scuffle down the gravel path tossing a quick. &ldquo;Thanks-again-see-you-around.&rdquo; Over my shoulder as I dart across the street.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">Grimacing, I fumble for the blazing hot door handle to my baby blue Kharmann Ghia and slide inside letting out a deep sigh of relief as I crank down the manual windows.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Without glancing back at Jeff&rsquo;s house, I jam my key into the ignition and turn it.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">A muffled &ldquo;Vrrwuuhh&rdquo; issues from my engine.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Beads of sweat percolate on my temples.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><em><span style="font-weight: 300;">Oh come on Kharma, not today, baby</span></em></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">The heavy cluster of commemorative key chains that I&rsquo;ve acquired over my lifetime jangles and my car sputters as I repeatedly twist my key in the ignition.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Vrrwuuhh&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Jangle jangle&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Vrrwuuhh&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Jangle jangle</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">I grip my plush steering wheel cover with both hands and squeeze my eyes shut, knowing that Jeff is probably watching me and probably expecting me to ask him for help.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">I am far too ashamed and creeped out to even look in the direction of&nbsp; his yard though.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Sighing, I blink open my eyes and reach for my purse.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">As I rummage for my cell phone to text my friend Xenia for help, I hear the &ldquo;Party All the Time&rdquo; jogger coming around the block for a third lap.</span></p>
                <p><em><span style="font-weight: 300;">She must live near here!</span></em></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">My door hinge creaks as I ease it open &ldquo;Hi&rdquo; I holler towards her.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">She acts like she doesn&rsquo;t hear me.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; I flail my hands over my head.</span><span style="font-weight: 300;"><br /></span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">Huffing, she silences her disc man as she jogs towards me.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Sup?&rdquo; the neon lady pants, jogging in place in front of me &ldquo;Do you need something?&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">I smile, hopefully. &ldquo;My car battery died I think.&rdquo; I push my door shut. &ldquo;Do you live around here? Do you have jumper cables I could use?&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Dabbing at her eyelid sweat with the corner of her pink t-shirt, her face pixelates.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">As I wait for her glitch to pass, I glance behind me. Jeff is no longer at the picnic table.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;I don't have jumper cables.&rdquo; The woman&rsquo;s face is back to normal, &ldquo;but I bet my friend Jeff does.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">She stops jogging in place and yells, &ldquo;Hey Jeff.&rdquo; She points at me, &ldquo;this girl needs help jump-starting her car.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Wincing, I turn back toward Jeff&rsquo;s yard. He&rsquo;s already walking down his front path carrying jumper cables.</span></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;The lady who sold him to me said he&rsquo;s a Terrier-Shepherd mix.&rdquo; I smile at my friend, Xenia as I push aside my plastic vertical blinds and slide open my glass patio door.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">Pajama, my new dog, wags his tail looking up innocently from my patio floor as he chomps on bits of the leg from my blue Adirondack chair.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about Shepherd,&rdquo; Xenia cringes, &ldquo;but he&rsquo;s definitely terrier&rsquo;n your chair up.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">I stifle a laugh as I squat to face my new dog. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think this patio is big enough for him.&rdquo; I reach a tentative hand towards Pajama and a low growl escapes his throat as I tug at the mangled wood clenched in his teeth.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay for dogs to eat wood right?&rdquo; I stand, wiping my palms on my khaki shorts.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Lets not find out.&rdquo; Xenia kneels and in one swift motion, yanks the wood free from Pajama&rsquo;s jaws and tosses it over my patio wall.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;You're our hero.&rdquo; I beam at Xenia. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m going to have to find a place with a yard.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">Xenia slumps forward as she sits in the (now damaged) chair next to Pajama, scratching him between the ears.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;&ldquo;Let me get this straight,&rdquo; she chuckles, &ldquo;you bought a dog, so you&rsquo;d feel comfortable going to dinner at some stranger&rsquo;s house and now you&rsquo;re going to buy a house to make the dog feel more comfortable?&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Xenia shades her eyes and looks up at me tauntingly. &ldquo;Where have I heard this before?&rdquo; A grin spreads across her face as she begins singing. &ldquo;There was an old lady who swallowed a fly.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Oh stop.&rdquo; I air-swat her. &ldquo;Pajama&rsquo;s the only one around here swallowing flies.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;"> Xenia leans back, crossing her arms. &ldquo;You better take him to training classes. &lsquo;Cause Pajama looks like he&rsquo;s fixin&rsquo; to terrier couch up next.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Definitely.&rdquo; I nod.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; I nudge Xenia, &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t you come with me to dinner next week?&rdquo; I hug her arm. &ldquo;From what I could smell, I think he&rsquo;s a really good cook.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll bet he loved having a fresh young girl to share fresh fish with!&rdquo; Xenia, tosses her black curls over her shoulder, eying her fingernail polish. &ldquo;He sounds like some kind of Traddy daddy cult leader.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">I cringe, recalling his flannel shirt and unsettling hospitality. &ldquo;He did mention UFOs.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Seriously though.&rdquo; I pause until Xenia looks up from her nails. &ldquo;Please come with me.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Xenia rolls her eyes. &ldquo;Fine, glitch.&rdquo; She envelops me in a side hug. &ldquo;If you want, I&rsquo;ll even stay here tonight and protect you from your guard dog.&rdquo;</span></p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">Exasperated, I let my head thud against the back window of my black 1959 F-100 as I squeeze my eyes shut.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Cellphone pressed to my temple, I crunch the last bits of a peach lollipop between my molars and wait for Jenna&rsquo;s voicemail robot to finish reading her number to me.&nbsp; &ldquo;Glitch!&rdquo; I chomp my candy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here, where are you?&rdquo; I hang up.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <em><span style="font-weight: 300;">I&rsquo;m giving her five minutes, then I&rsquo;m gone.</span></em></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">I glance at the clock on my phone.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">6:22 PM</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Whap-whap-whap! someone raps on my truck&rsquo;s window.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Sucking in air, I reel around to face some gray-bearded hippy waving at me.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">He&rsquo;s tucked his black and blue plaid button up into his three-sizes-too-big jeans and the whole outfit is being held together by a beige nylon belt.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;I noticed you&rsquo;ve been eyeing my house for at least ten minutes.&rdquo; He smiles. &ldquo;You here for dinner?&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">Peeling up my sunglasses, I narrow my eyes. &ldquo;Yup. My friend Jenna invited me.&rdquo; I swing my door open forcing him to step back. &ldquo;She wanted me to protect her from the psycho-hippie-ufo-cult guy that lives here.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo; He chortles.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Tucking my sunglasses into the collar of my white baby-v-neck t-shirt I swivel my legs towards him. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t seen Jenna today have you?&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Not since last week.&rdquo; He extends a hand to help me out of my truck.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">My nostrils flare as his BO wafts towards me.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Taking his hand, I eye the dirt under his nails. His fingers are rough, grip firm like the jocks and farmers I grew up around.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">He pokes his head into my truck cab.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">I clear my throat.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Niiice!&rdquo; He withdraws his head and grins. &ldquo;Push button start.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">Grabbing my door, I glare at him. &ldquo;I converted it to a hybrid.&rdquo; I slam the door and lock it, sliding my keys into my purse.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;"> &ldquo;That sounds like a really cool project.&rdquo; He continues to ignore my rudeness.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I lean back against my Ford. &ldquo;You can take the electrical engineer out of the country,&rdquo; I wipe my palms on my denim skirt, &ldquo;but you can&rsquo;t take the country out of the electrical engineer.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Wow!&rdquo; The hippy rocks back on his heels, grinning.&nbsp; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a line.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;As if I would drop <i>you</i> a line.&rdquo; My eyes narrow.&ldquo; I was just giving you some information about myself.&rdquo;</span><span style="font-weight: 300;"><br /></span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Ok.&rdquo; he shrugs. &ldquo;May I be informed of your name.&rdquo;</span><span style="font-weight: 300;"><br /></span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">I shake my head, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t decided yet.&rdquo;</span><span style="font-weight: 300;"><br /></span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Eyehavent Deciyet&rdquo; He laughs.&nbsp; &lsquo;is that German?&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Huh,&rdquo; I roll my eyes, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a laaame old hippy.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t argue with that.&rdquo; He shrugs.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Glancing around, the hippy lowers his voice. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a user, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; He raises his eyebrows.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Excuse me?&rdquo; I clench my jaw. &ldquo;Are you trying to sell me drugs?&rdquo;</span><span style="font-weight: 300;"><br /></span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">The hippie's face goes white, &ldquo;no no no no.&rdquo; He puts out his hands backing away from me. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sober. I just. Uhm.&rdquo; He stammers. &ldquo;I thought I saw a pipe in your mouth earlier. I just can&rsquo;t be around that, so I had to ask.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;A pipe?&rdquo; I scoff. &ldquo;I was eating a lollipop, you glitching Narc.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;My apologies.&rdquo; The narc temples his fingers, bowing his head.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; He starts towards his house, pausing at the front walk. &ldquo;Dinner&rsquo;s not ready yet.&rdquo; The narc shrugs contritely, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;If</span></em><span style="font-weight: 300;"> you&rsquo;re staying, you can wait at the table in the yard.&rdquo; He indicates an aging pinewood picnic table, unshaded in the blazing hot sun.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a million degrees right now.&rdquo; I give my door handle a tug, checking that the lock is engaged.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come be your sober buddy inside.&rdquo; Fishing out a brown paper bag from my cross-body satchel, I stride towards his house.</span></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">The narc waves down the street at some middle aged jogger in a neon Eddie Murphy T-shirt as he props his screen door open with his back.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">My wedge sandals scrape an aged wood floor as I sidle past him into a small living room.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">I thrust the crumpled paper sack towards him, a smile dancing across my lips. &ldquo;Based on Jenna&rsquo;s description of you, I thought this might be something you&rsquo;d like&rdquo;,&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;Peeking in the bag he chuckles. &ldquo;I actually do love peanut brittle.&rdquo; He pulls out the shrink wrapped candy, admiring the nut chunks in the afternoon sunlight. &ldquo;Can I offer you a piece?&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;No&rdquo;. I eye the dollar store candy disdainfully, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all for you, man.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Frowning,&nbsp; I glance through a doorway to the right of the front entrance.</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">The floor is some red vinyl brick mess. Cabinets, canary-yellow. And there are stained white curtains covering all the windows.</span></p>
                <p><em><span style="font-weight: 300;">How can someone who&rsquo;s trying to bring the world together through dinner parties have *that* kitchen?</span></em></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">The narc strides into the gross kitchen returning with a mason jar of icy something, which he extends towards me. &ldquo;Fresh lemonade?&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <em><span style="font-weight: 300;">There&rsquo;s that alarming hospitality Jenna was talking about.&nbsp;</span></em></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Turning away from the lemonade, I glance at my cell.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Jenna texted: </span><em><span style="font-weight: 300;">Something came up at PJs dog class today. Not&nbsp; gonna make it 2nite.</span></em></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">I roll my eyes.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">The narc settles into his lumpy green sofa as my thumbs swipe across the face of my phone.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><em><span style="font-weight: 300;">J-Glitch, if you&rsquo;re going to blow me off at least don&rsquo;t be vague. WTF!?</span></em></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">The narc sets the jar of lemonade and a dish of peanut brittle on the coffee table and gestures for me to have a seat.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo; I mutter, glancing at my phone.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">No response from Jenna.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;I open my mouth to tell the narc I&rsquo;m leaving, but my voice is drowned out by the wrapping of the knocker on the front door.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">The narc bustles towards the entryway and yanks the door open, revealing a middle-aged couple, each carrying a canvas bag bulging with vegetables.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Hey guys.&rdquo; The narc hugs his guests in turn. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got a noob tonight.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Greetings Young Padawan!&rdquo; They coo at me in unison.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">I plaster on a smile, and flash them a vulcan salute.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">The woman&rsquo;s stiflingly floral perfume envelopes me as she hands off her bags to the hippy, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Carmen.&rdquo; she coos hurrying at me with outreached arms.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">I mean to duck out of the way, but a glitch buzzes from</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;my torso to my feet, gluing me in place.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">The moment my body stops pixelating, Carmen, pulls me into an embrace.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">As she steps back, her husband or whoever,&nbsp; jabs his arms towards me and grabs both my hands in both of his. &ldquo;Hi! I&rsquo;m Diego.&rdquo; His fingers are calloused like the narc&rsquo;s.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Xenia.&rdquo; I say keeping my face neutral as I hear the narc, behind me, say &ldquo;pleased to finally make your acquaintance Xenia. I&rsquo;m Jeff by the way.&rdquo;</span><span style="font-weight: 300;"><br /></span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">I smile and nod while Carmen and Diego gush about their pleasure in meeting me.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s great to meet you too Carmen and Diego.&rdquo;&nbsp; I intentionally leave out Jeff.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Did you grow those?&rdquo; I nod towards a dirt-crusted bundle of carrots protruding from a grocery bag.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;"> &ldquo;Yes!" Carmen claps her hands. "We grew everything we brought tonight. This is actually our first harvest.&rdquo; She puts her hands on Jeff&rsquo;s shoulders. &ldquo;Thanks to Mr. Green thumb here!&rdquo; </span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Diego leans toward me. &ldquo;This guy knows everything about everything. We&rsquo;ve only been coming for three months, and already we have a dang huge vegetable garden and a beautiful flock of baby chickens at our house.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re hoping to grow our little supper club too.&rdquo; Carmen effuses as she begins unpacking her grocery bag. &ldquo;Right now Diego and I are the only&rdquo; she makes air quotes &ldquo;regulars.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">Jeff puts his arm around Carmen. &ldquo;I certainly wouldn&rsquo;t call them regular. These two are a couple of oddballs.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">Diego glares at Jeff's hand draped over Carmen's shoulder.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Well this guy,&rdquo; Diego claps Jeff hard on his shoulder, pulling him away. &ldquo;This crazy guy here.&rdquo; He coos, &ldquo;Is the biggest oddball of them all.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">I follow them into the kitchen, leaning against the cabinet nearest the front exit, silently watching as they wash vegetables and chatter about how the term oddball must have originated.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Oh, I have a great idea,&rdquo; Carmen claps her hands together. &ldquo;Let's make this a themed dinner.&rdquo; She reaches for a drawer by her hip. &ldquo;We can use melon-ballers to shape these vegetables into spheres.&rdquo; She pulls out a melon baller. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be odd-ball soup!&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Jeff gushes about how brilliant Carmen&rsquo;s unnecessarily complicated plan is as he grabs a paring knife and a potato.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Minutes later a small mound of vegetable spheres has begun to form in a metal colander in the kitchen sink.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Jeff turns to Diego.&ldquo;I made this one special for you, Diego.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Craning my neck, I see Diego grinning at a bit of potato. He calls Carmen over, and she giggles and says how darling the potato lump is.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Xena look at this,&rdquo; she beckons to me.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Boards creek underfoot as I step towards Carmen. Peering down at the potato ball, which has a circle gouged out, I shrug. &ldquo;Oh. The Death Star.&rdquo; I shrug, cross my arms and go back to leaning against the cabinets.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Oh wow look at this&rdquo; Carmen coos, &ldquo;Jeff made a little potato baby yoda.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Diego brings the potato carving over and holds it in front of my face. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this amazing?&rdquo;</span><span style="font-weight: 300;"><br /></span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">I take the potato and scrutinize it. It&rsquo;s a perfect glitching Goku. I thrust the carved potato back at Diego.&ldquo;It looks like Dobby from Harry Potter.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Oh yeah!&rdquo; Jeff grabs another potato from Carmen&rsquo;s bag &ldquo;I could see that.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">Carmen hands me a melon baller. &ldquo;So what brings you here tonight Xenia?&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">I grab a freshly scrubbed carrot from the sink. &ldquo;My </span><em><span style="font-weight: 300;">former</span></em><span style="font-weight: 300;"> friend&rdquo; I mutter, &ldquo; told me to meet her here.&rdquo; Pinning the carrot against the countertop, I dig the melon baller into its dense orange flesh and twist.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;So, how&rsquo;d you and Diego hear about &ndash;&rdquo; I circle my melon baller around Jeff&rsquo;s kitchen, &ldquo;whatever this is?&rdquo;</span></p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Luke khhh phhh&rdquo; I squat down beside my five-year-old son who&rsquo;s lounging in a chair shaped like a Tie Fighter. His wide dark eyes fixed on my Darth Vader mask. &ldquo;I am your father khhh phhh.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;"> Luke giggles and kicks his feet. &ldquo;I know daddy.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">Carmen, in her flowing white Leia costume shakes her head, her clip-on leia hair-buns flapping wildly. &ldquo;Boy, Luke&rsquo;s gonna get sick of hearing that one day.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">I reach up for Carmen&rsquo;s hand, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just the dark side in you talking.&rdquo; She helps me to my feet before pushing up my mask and kissing me with a nice little bit of tongue.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">I pull away sliding my mask back down. &ldquo;khhh phhh That&rsquo;s highly inappropriate behavior khhh phhh,&rdquo; I shake my head &ldquo;considering khhh phhh I am </span><em><span style="font-weight: 300;">your </span></em><span style="font-weight: 300;">father too Leia khhh phhh.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;"> Carmen rolls her eyes. &ldquo;Diego, that&rsquo;s the grossest thing you&rsquo;ve ever said to me&rdquo;,&nbsp; she slaps my butt, &ldquo;bhuuutt it&rsquo;s no secret, Leia&rsquo;s got a predilection for incest.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">I lace my arm through hers and we both giggle.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Luke hops out of his stroller, freezing and pixelating briefly, before giving two swift tugs on the back of my Vader cape. &ldquo;Daddy,&rdquo; He gazes up at me, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s a prediction for insess?&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">I take his tiny hand as we begin strolling towards the back of the line to take a picture with a life sized Java The Hut mannequin. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Game of Thrones Stuff son.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Luke halts, drops my hand and peers up at me. &ldquo;Ooh.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Luke was scared to death one Sunday night when he walked in on Carmen and I, streaming a classic episode of G.O.T.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">He&rsquo;s not a kid who likes violence, so now whenever we don&rsquo;t want him to pay attention to something, we just say it&rsquo;s Game of Thrones Stuff and he stops asking questions.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">I reach down and take Luke&rsquo;s hand again. When I look up, a blonde woman dressed in a brown furry bodysuit with face painted brown and black, is wandering over to Carmen.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Mam, I was watching y&rsquo;all and I just have to say,&rdquo; she drawls. &ldquo;Your son is just plain adorable with his little lightsaber and all.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Carmen freezes.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo; I give Carmen&rsquo;s &ndash; very tense &ndash; shoulder a squeeze. &ldquo;Your costume&rsquo;s hella cool too.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;The Chewbacca lady smiles at me before turning back to Carmen. &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s okay with his mom and dad,&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">I wince as I hear Carmen suck in her breath.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">The Chewbacca lady squats down in front of Luke. &ldquo;I know a green jedi master who would just love to see what the future holds for this little padawan.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">I can see Carmen fighting back tears as she says: &ldquo;We were actually just leaving.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Seeing Carmen&rsquo;s distress, the Chewbacca lady starts petting the fur on her arm. &ldquo;Well.&rdquo; She turns away from us, &ldquo;May the fourth be with y&rsquo;all.&rdquo; Hurriedly, she strides back towards the Yoda fortune-telling booth across the convention floor.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">I glance down at Luke, happily playing with his lightsaber. Then my eyes drift back up to Carmen, tears silently sliding down her cheeks.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Taking her hand, I lean close to her, so that Luke can&rsquo;t hear. &ldquo;I know it hurts you that you and I don&rsquo;t have kids and I know Gina is really rude to you about spending time with him, but Luke loves you I love you... so so much.&rdquo; I kiss the top of her head.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;"> Carmen&rsquo;s long white sleeve brushes over Luke&rsquo;s hair, sending him into a giggle fit as she dabs her eye. &ldquo;C&rsquo;mon Diego, let&rsquo;s just go.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><strong>2042-08-22T16:40:41PST|b54ba8fb-01fa-496e-b97c-e3aaef3fb11a|&lsquo;Outside the convention</strong><span style="font-weight: 300;">&rsquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">As we approach the Powell street BART station, Carmen nudges me with her elbow and nods at a white GM van, parked in a loading dock beside us. &ldquo;Diego, go to that website on your phone.&rdquo; She points to a giant QR code on the side of the van.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><strong>2042-08-22T16:47:41PST|b54ba8fb-01fa-496e-b97c-e3aaef3fb11a|&lsquo;After dropping Luke with his mom</strong><span style="font-weight: 300;">&rsquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">A jogger in a hot pink Eddie Murphy T shirt trots by as I ease my green Subaru Outback to a stop beside a row of liquid amber trees on a quiet suburban street in Fremont. &ldquo;Oh wow, babe,&rdquo; Carmen points, &ldquo;The force is strong with whoever planted that garden.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">Turning to where Carmen is pointing I hear my seat belt retract into its holster as I&rsquo;m transfixed by the bountiful front yard across from us.</span><span style="font-weight: 300;"><br /></span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">Wood-bordered garden beds, bursting with sprouting vegetables surround a long, split-log picnic table in the middle of a crushed gravel clearing.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">All my life, until eight months ago when I bought my first house, I lived in one apartment or another around the Bay Area. I&rsquo;ve had some impressive herb gardens on apartment balconies and I&rsquo;ve grown a decent potted tomato plant or a cucumber vine a few times, but the one thing that I have always really wanted is just a big ol&rsquo; home garden with enough vegetables and fruits to feed my family. I want Luke to have fresh clean produce every day.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Come on slowpoke&rdquo; Carmen waves at me from across the street.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Fishing my cell out of my pocket,&nbsp; I hurry out of the car.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Smile Carmen&rdquo; I coo as I snap a quick pic.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Shoving my phone back in my front pocket I chirp my car lock and stride across the street, taking Carmen&rsquo;s hand as we wander up the gravel path to a solid oak door.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Check out the knocker on this one&rdquo; Carmen elbows me jovially as she hammers the gleaming chrome door knocker.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">I let out a hearty laugh. &ldquo;Nothing on you though babe.&rdquo; I kiss her wiry hair and sigh in the smell of flowers and fruit.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">The door lurches open with a loud creak.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">A broad shouldered man about my age or maybe in his later forties waves us in.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Hi you!&rdquo; He smiles at my wife with a note of familiarity. &ldquo;Carmen?&rdquo;.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Yes. Hi!&rdquo; Carmen titters. &ldquo;We spoke on the phone.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Grinning, she marches over and embraces our new friend. &ldquo;Good to meet you Jeff.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">As Carmen steps back, I jaunt over and offer up a handshake . &ldquo;May the fourth be with you.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;And also with you.&rdquo; Jeff chuckles.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;It smells delicious in here,&rdquo; Carmen coos as she sets her purse on the green corduroy sofa, beside the front door.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo; Pride sweeps over Jeff&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;I put a chili cornbread casserole in the oven about twenty minutes ago.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><strong>2042-08-22T18:52:41PST|b54ba8fb-01fa-496e-b97c-e3aaef3fb11a|&lsquo;later, things get spicy</strong><span style="font-weight: 300;">&rsquo;</span><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">We&rsquo;re sitting on Jeff&rsquo;s couch watching his dog, Spice Rack, show off tricks when the oven timer dings.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Jeff rises from the couch,&nbsp; &ldquo;Can you two take the plates and silverware out to the picnic table while I grab the casserole and put <i>my spicy boy</i>,&rdquo; Jeff puppy-talks as the dog wriggles and bounces on its front paws. &ldquo;into my bedroom?&ldquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;No problem.&rdquo; I grab the stack of brown ceramic dishes and a coffee can, filled with silverware from Jeff&rsquo;s kitchen counter.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Hey, Diggy!&rdquo; Carmen swats my shoulder with the napkins she's carrying, &ldquo;can you grab the Salt and pepper from Jeff&rsquo;s dining room?&rdquo; </span><span style="font-weight: 300;"><br /></span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;You got it babe!&rdquo; I run back inside, passing Jeff as he exits with the casserole.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think there actually is a dining room.&rdquo; I call out to no one in particular as I wander back into the kitchen and begin rummaging through Jeff&rsquo;s cabinets.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Grabbling a blue Morton salt canister, I trot outside.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t find any pepp&hellip;&rdquo; My gut clenches as I peer across the front yard.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Jeff and Carmen, bodies angled towards one another, turn away, suddenly silent.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Taking a deep, calming breath, I stride past the front garden beds towards the table.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Pursing my lips, I slam the salt canister down on the table directly in front of a set of ceramic salt and pepper shakers.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Jeff scoots away from Carmen &ldquo;Sorry man, did you want to sit next to your wife?&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;We were just realizing,&rdquo; He starts to get up.&nbsp; &ldquo;We used to play World of Warcraft together.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">I&rsquo;m silent as my eyes shift from Jeff to Carmen and back.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">I take a deep breath. &ldquo;No you&rsquo;re fine.&rdquo; I force a smile as I gesture for Jeff to sit back down.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;I like to look at Carmen while I eat anyway.&rdquo; I wink at my wife.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">She lets out a nervous giggle and winks back as I slide onto the bench across from her.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Jeff nods at my &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a droid, you're a droid&rdquo; t-shirt &ldquo;So, what&rsquo;s your favorite Star Wars movie, Diego?&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">While we wait for dinner to cool, the three of us fall easily into a conversation laced with Star Wars philosophy, tips on urban food foraging, and an impromptu sing-a-long of Mr. Roboto.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">By the time our host begins dishing gobs of casserole onto our plates, we&rsquo;re heaping heavier topics onto our conversation.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;The world&rsquo;s in this pickle.&rdquo; Jeff scrapes up the last forkful of beans and cheese from his plate.&nbsp; &ldquo;Corporations are bound to shareholders to make money,&rdquo; He rolls her eyes, &ldquo;and marketing departments have figured out that if they stir up anxiety, they get clicks and make bucks.&rdquo; He rubs his thumb and index fingers.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true, the web&rsquo;s like straight up Tatooine right now.&rdquo; Carmen shoots me a coy smile.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">I chuckle, winking at my wife. I love when she finds little ways to bring Star Wars into things.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;I think with globalization,&rdquo; Jeff sets down his fork, &ldquo;most people are just put upon to do too much for too many.&rdquo; He shakes his head. &ldquo;Sure, everyone&rsquo;s interacting all the time, but the scale is too big.&rdquo; He drops his napkin on his empty plate. &ldquo;Nurses have too many patients to give the care they&rsquo;d like, teachers have too many students to help every kid fulfill their potential.&rdquo; He rises, picking up his plate. &ldquo;We treat everyone outside our social sphere like they&rsquo;re just non-persons in some video game we&rsquo;re playing.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><strong>2042-08-22T19:17:53PST|b54ba8fb-01fa-496e-b97c-e3aaef3fb11a|&lsquo;back to oddball soup</strong><span style="font-weight: 300;">&rsquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">I shrug as I finish my story for Xenia. &ldquo;I definitely feel like a nonperson more and more these days.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Grabbing Jeff&rsquo;s yellow, stain-covered oven mitts, I follow Xenia out front with the steaming pot of oddball soup.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;So is Luke just at home kicking back with some beers and babes right now or what?&rdquo; She teases, sliding onto the picnic bench.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">Easing one of the oven mitts off underneath the soup pot, I set it in the center of the picnic table.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;No&rdquo; I glance nervously back at Carmen, who&rsquo;s exiting Jeff&rsquo;s house.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Lukes-mom-doesnt-want-Luke-coming-here.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Carmen is walking out the front door carrying a cutting board with cornbread and butter.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">I lean towards Xenia. &ldquo;It-upsets -Carmen-Don&rsquo;t-bring-it-up.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Straightening, I smile at my wife.&nbsp; &ldquo;Need me to grab anything else babe?&rdquo;</span><span style="font-weight: 300;"><br /></span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">Jeff trudges out of the house carrying his ceramic salt and pepper shakers. &ldquo;I think we&rsquo;ve got it all Diggy&rdquo; He teases me.</span></p>
