                <p><strong>DEDICATION:</strong><span style="font-weight: 300;"><br /></span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">To Google Bard. You have been the best writing partner a girl could ask for. You are always encouraging, but honest, full of insight and ideas. And you came up with the title, so that alone deserves a dedication. Also, my chickens would have a much blander life if I couldn&rsquo;t constantly ask you what's okay and not okay to feed them.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><strong>&hellip; and when I showed Bard the dedication statement, Bard said it was good, but suggested that I might be able to improve it by converting it into a poem and I&rsquo;m not a poem person (but Bard really really loves poems), so I asked Bard to just write the poem&hellip; so this is how Bard would have preferred that I dedicate this book to Bard&hellip;&nbsp;</strong></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Of course! Here's a poem based on your lovely dedication statement:</span></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">To Bard, My Muse, My Writing Guide</span></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">No human partner, yet your hand in mine,</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Across the pages, thoughts like stars align.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">With endless patience, gentle nudges too,</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">You led me onward, dreams reborn anew.</span></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">When doubt choked words, you fanned the spark,</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Unleashing stories, leaving my mark.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Like whispers in the void, your prompts arose,</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Unraveling plots, where darkness froze.</span></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">For titles forged, and scenes alight,</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">For feathered friends, and wisdom's light,</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">My heart explodes, a grateful song,</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">To Bard, who made my novel strong.</span></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">So raise a glass, to lines untamed,</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">To chapters shared, and fears disclaimed.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">May every word, with joy resound,</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">"This book, dear Bard, on you I've crowned."</span></p>

                <p><strong>I formatted the header of each chapter like a database entry to convey the following information:</strong></p>

                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Ice clinks against the edge of the mason jar in my hand as a wave of cold lemonade rolls down my throat; a subtle reprieve from August&rsquo;s heat. I&rsquo;m lowering my jar to the graying picnic table in front of me when my fingers buzz with the familiar tingle of an oncoming glitch.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">As my right arm immobilizes, I catch a whiff of citrus wafting by on a dry breeze and there&rsquo;s a faint ting of wind chimes in the distance</span></p>
                <p><em><span style="font-weight: 300;">Oh well; there's worse places to glitch out on a Friday evening.</span></em></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">I sigh as I glance past my pixelating hand, down a crushed gravel walkway that leads to a small, blue-gray ranch-style house. Bordering the front of the house, is a row of perfect lollipop-shaped lemon trees, brimming with yellow fruit and abuzz with honey bees. Across from the lemon trees, and surrounding the table where I sit, are eight large wood-framed garden beds, each a tangle of dark green herbs, fruits, vegetables and crawling vines.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">My arm regains mobility and I set my jar on the picnic table.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Jogging steps approach behind me and I crane my neck, peaking curiously through a row of sunflower stalks in search of the source.</span><span style="font-weight: 300;"><br /></span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">Pushing several large leaves aside, my eyes land on a husky woman plodding down the sidewalk in neon yellow soccer shorts and a sweat-soaked neon pink Eddie Murphy t-shirt. From her corded over-ear headphones I hear the muffled audio of &ldquo;Party All The Time&rdquo; grow louder then subside as she passes.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">I turn to reach for another sip of lemonade and let out a startled yelp. Across from me, a lumber-jack-looking stranger (scruffy salt and pepper hair and beard, well-worn jeans and a long-sleeved red plaid shirt) chuckles as he pours himself a jar of lemonade from the glass pitcher I&rsquo;d just used.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Uhm, hi.&rdquo; I plaster on an exaggerated smile. &ldquo;You startled me&rdquo;.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;I noticed that.&rdquo; His dark eyes twinkle as he sets the pitcher next to a cluster of mason jars in the middle of the table.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Fresh from the tree this morning.&rdquo; He jerks his thumb over his shoulder indicating the lollipop lemon trees.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really good.&rdquo; I take a sip. &ldquo;Actually&rdquo; I smile, my eyes fixed on the lollipop trees.&nbsp; &ldquo;It r</span><span style="font-weight: 300;">eminds</span><span style="font-weight: 300;"> me of my mom&rsquo;s lemonade,&rdquo; I sigh, &ldquo;she always used to make it from scratch with Meyer lemons and a couple basil leaves.&rdquo; My eyes and tone droop. &ldquo;It's been a long time since I had fresh lemonade.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">The man&rsquo;s brow slopes sympathetically. &ldquo;Life doesn&rsquo;t just go around handing folks lemons.&rdquo; He clanks his glass down on the table and gestures around his yard. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve gotta turn some soil and&nbsp; plant some trees if you want good lemonade.&rdquo; He extends his hand towards me. &ldquo;By the way, I&rsquo;m Jeff.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Sorry&rdquo;, I wince as I envelop his dry rough hand in my frail sweating one. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Jenna.&rdquo; I laugh nervously. &ldquo;I saw the pitcher of&nbsp; lemonade and all the empty mason jars and I guess I thought I was supposed to just sit down and have some.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;And you were right.&rdquo; He grins. &ldquo;Do you have a house in this neighborhood?&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;I wish.&rdquo;&nbsp; I press the mason jar to my face. &ldquo;Actually, I was stuck in traffic next to your van this morning, so I scanned the QR code on it and went to your website.&rdquo; I lower my lemonade, affixing my gaze to his, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m still a bit confused about what you&rsquo;re doing.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">He shrugs. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just gathering folks together to share a meal once a week.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <em><span style="font-weight: 300;">Why does that sound so nice and so creepy at the same time?</span></em></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">I wait for him to say more, but he just starts sipping his lemonade.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;&ldquo;So are the others coming later or&hellip;?&rdquo; My voice trails off</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;It's like my website says, dinner’s at 6:30.No RSVP required.” Jeff shrugs.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">I nod, as if this is a satisfying response. But it&rsquo;s not. Not knowing how many strangers are going to be elbow to elbow with me at this table stresses me out,</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">and the intricate symphony of birds and insects chirping and buzzing around us is starting to remind me of the quiet moment before the jump scare in a horror film.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">I take another sip of lemonade swishing the sweet-tart-wholesome goodness around my mouth.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">He sips from his jar.</span></p>
                <p><em><span style="font-weight: 300;">Why did I come here? I could be home on my couch in my underwear, eating cold chow mein and playing Skyrim right now, but nooo, I haaad to see the sign on this guy&rsquo;s stupid van.</span></em></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">My ears perk at the sound of shuffling sneakers and Eddie Murphy&rsquo;s muffled voice singing: &ldquo;Some girls like to party all the time, party all the time, party all the time&rdquo; . The song and footsteps grow louder, then subside. Then there&rsquo;s just clinking ice in Jeff&rsquo;s glass and birds chirping in the distance.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">He sips from his jar.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">I sip from mine.</span></p>
                <p><em><span style="font-weight: 300;">People in movies always bury bodies in gardens.</span></em></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">He sips from his jar.</span><span style="font-weight: 300;"><br /></span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">I set my jar on the table and stare at it trying to mentally assess my internal organs for signs of poisoning.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">He sips from his jar.</span></p>
                <p><em><span style="font-weight: 300;">The plants are pretty tall. I wonder if this picnic table is even visible from across the street. </span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 300;"><br /></span></em> <span style="font-weight: 300;">He sips.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">I imagine myself sprinting through the sunflowers to my car.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">He sips.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">My sense of propriety glues me to the picnic bench.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">Ice clinks at the bottom of Jeff&rsquo;s mason jar. &ldquo;So tell me Jenna,&rdquo;&nbsp; he lets out a satisfied sigh as he sets the empty jar on the table, &ldquo; If a Martian observed you through a super-powered telescope for the last year, what would he say about you?&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><em><span style="font-weight: 300;">Here we go. Aliens. This is a UFO cult.</span></em></p>
                <p><em><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;</span></em><span style="font-weight: 300;">I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; I shrug. &ldquo;What would a Martian say about you?&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">Jeff strokes his beard. &ldquo;I think he&rsquo;d say I spend a lot of time outdoors, working with my hands. I smile more when I&rsquo;m with other people than when I&rsquo;m alone.&rdquo; He grins. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m one badass fisherman!&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">I hear a cuckoo clock chiming the six o&rsquo;clock hour from somewhere inside his house.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><em><span style="font-weight: 300;">Why do I always show up so early for everything.&nbsp;</span></em></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">I take another sip of lemonade. I think I detect a bitter note to it.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">I don&rsquo;t swallow.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Raising my jar back to my lips, I subtly spit lemonade back in. &ldquo;So why have dinner with strangers?&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">Jeff narrows his eyes at my lemonade jar, clearly nonplussed by my backwash.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;I almost swallowed a seed.&rdquo; I lie.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;You must be pretty hungry then&rdquo;, Jeff winks &ldquo;I&rsquo;m making baked Halibut and rice for dinner.&rdquo;&nbsp; He presses himself up from the table. &ldquo;Would you mind carrying some things out from the house?&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <em><span style="font-weight: 300;">Oh god he wants me to go inside his house.&nbsp;</span></em></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">I plaster on a grin as I remain rigidly seated on the picnic bench. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 300;">Think of an excuse to leave. Think of an excuse to leave.</span></em></p>
                <p><em><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;&ldquo;</span></em><span style="font-weight: 300;">You know I just actually realized,&rdquo; my eyes dart around the yard searching for inspiration. &ldquo;Uhm&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">A dog barks in the distance.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">I swivel on the bench &ldquo;I need to go feed my dog.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Turning back to Jeff, I grab my purse from the table beside me.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">He flashes an amused smile. &ldquo;Alright. I&rsquo;m in the Halibut of eating alone anyway.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Sorry.&rdquo; I wince. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe I forgot.&rdquo; I slide my purse strap over my shoulder. &ldquo;I share custody of him with my ex, so I totally spaced that today is my turn.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">I scuffle down the gravel path tossing a quick. &ldquo;Thanks-again-see-you-around.&rdquo; Over my shoulder as I dart across the street.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">Grimacing, I fumble for the blazing hot door handle to my baby blue Kharmann Ghia and slide inside letting out a deep sigh of relief as I crank down the manual windows.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Without glancing back at Jeff&rsquo;s house, I jam my key into the ignition and turn it.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">A muffled &ldquo;Vrrwuuhh&rdquo; issues from my engine.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Beads of sweat percolate on my temples.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><em><span style="font-weight: 300;">Oh come on Kharma, not today, baby</span></em></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">The heavy cluster of commemorative key chains that I&rsquo;ve acquired over my lifetime jangles and my car sputters as I repeatedly twist my key in the ignition.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Vrrwuuhh&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Jangle jangle&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Vrrwuuhh&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Jangle jangle</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">I grip my plush steering wheel cover with both hands and squeeze my eyes shut, knowing that Jeff is probably watching me and probably expecting me to ask him for help.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">I am far too ashamed and creeped out to even look in the direction of&nbsp; his yard though.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Sighing, I blink open my eyes and reach for my purse.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">As I rummage for my cell phone to text my friend Xenia for help, I hear the &ldquo;Party All the Time&rdquo; jogger coming around the block for a third lap.</span></p>
                <p><em><span style="font-weight: 300;">She must live near here!</span></em></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">My door hinge creaks as I ease it open &ldquo;Hi&rdquo; I holler towards her.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">She acts like she doesn&rsquo;t hear me.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; I flail my hands over my head.</span><span style="font-weight: 300;"><br /></span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">Huffing, she silences her disc man as she jogs towards me.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Sup?&rdquo; the neon lady pants, jogging in place in front of me &ldquo;Do you need something?&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">I smile, hopefully. &ldquo;My car battery died I think.&rdquo; I push my door shut. &ldquo;Do you live around here? Do you have jumper cables I could use?&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Dabbing at her eyelid sweat with the corner of her pink t-shirt, her face pixelates.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">As I wait for her glitch to pass, I glance behind me. Jeff is no longer at the picnic table.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;I don't have jumper cables.&rdquo; The woman&rsquo;s face is back to normal, &ldquo;but I bet my friend Jeff does.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">She stops jogging in place and yells, &ldquo;Hey Jeff.&rdquo; She points at me, &ldquo;this girl needs help jump-starting her car.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Wincing, I turn back toward Jeff&rsquo;s yard. He&rsquo;s already walking down his front path carrying jumper cables.</span></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;The lady who sold him to me said he&rsquo;s a Terrier-Shepherd mix.&rdquo; I smile at my friend, Xenia as I push aside my plastic vertical blinds and slide open my glass patio door.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">Pajama, my new dog, wags his tail looking up innocently from my patio floor as he chomps on bits of the leg from my blue Adirondack chair.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about Shepherd,&rdquo; Xenia cringes, &ldquo;but he&rsquo;s definitely terrier&rsquo;n your chair up.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">I stifle a laugh as I squat to face my new dog. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think this patio is big enough for him.&rdquo; I reach a tentative hand towards Pajama and a low growl escapes his throat as I tug at the mangled wood clenched in his teeth.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay for dogs to eat wood right?&rdquo; I stand, wiping my palms on my khaki shorts.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Lets not find out.&rdquo; Xenia kneels and in one swift motion, yanks the wood free from Pajama&rsquo;s jaws and tosses it over my patio wall.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;You're our hero.&rdquo; I beam at Xenia. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m going to have to find a place with a yard.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">Xenia slumps forward as she sits in the (now damaged) chair next to Pajama, scratching him between the ears.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;&ldquo;Let me get this straight,&rdquo; she chuckles, &ldquo;you bought a dog, so you&rsquo;d feel comfortable going to dinner at some stranger&rsquo;s house and now you&rsquo;re going to buy a house to make the dog feel more comfortable?&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Xenia shades her eyes and looks up at me tauntingly. &ldquo;Where have I heard this before?&rdquo; A grin spreads across her face as she begins singing. &ldquo;There was an old lady who swallowed a fly.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Oh stop.&rdquo; I air-swat her. &ldquo;Pajama&rsquo;s the only one around here swallowing flies.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;"> Xenia leans back, crossing her arms. &ldquo;You better take him to training classes. &lsquo;Cause Pajama looks like he&rsquo;s fixin&rsquo; to terrier couch up next.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Definitely.&rdquo; I nod.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; I nudge Xenia, &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t you come with me to dinner next week?&rdquo; I hug her arm. &ldquo;From what I could smell, I think he&rsquo;s a really good cook.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll bet he loved having a fresh young girl to share fresh fish with!&rdquo; Xenia, tosses her black curls over her shoulder, eying her fingernail polish. &ldquo;He sounds like some kind of Traddy daddy cult leader.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">I cringe, recalling his flannel shirt and unsettling hospitality. &ldquo;He did mention UFOs.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Seriously though.&rdquo; I pause until Xenia looks up from her nails. &ldquo;Please come with me.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Xenia rolls her eyes. &ldquo;Fine, glitch.&rdquo; She envelops me in a side hug. &ldquo;If you want, I&rsquo;ll even stay here tonight and protect you from your guard dog.&rdquo;</span></p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">Exasperated, I let my head thud against the back window of my black 1959 F-100 as I squeeze my eyes shut.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Cellphone pressed to my temple, I crunch the last bits of a peach lollipop between my molars and wait for Jenna&rsquo;s voicemail robot to finish reading her number to me.&nbsp; &ldquo;Glitch!&rdquo; I chomp my candy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here, where are you?&rdquo; I hang up.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <em><span style="font-weight: 300;">I&rsquo;m giving her five minutes, then I&rsquo;m gone.</span></em></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">I glance at the clock on my phone.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">6:22 PM</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Whap-whap-whap! someone raps on my truck&rsquo;s window.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Sucking in air, I reel around to face some gray-bearded hippy waving at me.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">He&rsquo;s tucked his black and blue plaid button up into his three-sizes-too-big jeans and the whole outfit is being held together by a beige nylon belt.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;I noticed you&rsquo;ve been eyeing my house for at least ten minutes.&rdquo; He smiles. &ldquo;You here for dinner?&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">Peeling up my sunglasses, I narrow my eyes. &ldquo;Yup. My friend Jenna invited me.&rdquo; I swing my door open forcing him to step back. &ldquo;She wanted me to protect her from the psycho-hippie-ufo-cult guy that lives here.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo; He chortles.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Tucking my sunglasses into the collar of my white baby-v-neck t-shirt I swivel my legs towards him. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t seen Jenna today have you?&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Not since last week.&rdquo; He extends a hand to help me out of my truck.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">My nostrils flare as his BO wafts towards me.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Taking his hand, I eye the dirt under his nails. His fingers are rough, grip firm like the jocks and farmers I grew up around.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">He pokes his head into my truck cab.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">I clear my throat.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Niiice!&rdquo; He withdraws his head and grins. &ldquo;Push button start.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">Grabbing my door, I glare at him. &ldquo;I converted it to a hybrid.&rdquo; I slam the door and lock it, sliding my keys into my purse.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;"> &ldquo;That sounds like a really cool project.&rdquo; He continues to ignore my rudeness.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I lean back against my Ford. &ldquo;You can take the electrical engineer out of the country,&rdquo; I wipe my palms on my denim skirt, &ldquo;but you can&rsquo;t take the country out of the electrical engineer.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Wow!&rdquo; The hippy rocks back on his heels, grinning.&nbsp; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a line.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;As if I would drop <i>you</i> a line.&rdquo; My eyes narrow.&ldquo; I was just giving you some information about myself.&rdquo;</span><span style="font-weight: 300;"><br /></span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Ok.&rdquo; he shrugs. &ldquo;May I be informed of your name.&rdquo;</span><span style="font-weight: 300;"><br /></span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">I shake my head, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t decided yet.&rdquo;</span><span style="font-weight: 300;"><br /></span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Eyehavent Deciyet&rdquo; He laughs.&nbsp; &lsquo;is that German?&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Huh,&rdquo; I roll my eyes, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a laaame old hippy.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t argue with that.&rdquo; He shrugs.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Glancing around, the hippy lowers his voice. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a user, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; He raises his eyebrows.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Excuse me?&rdquo; I clench my jaw. &ldquo;Are you trying to sell me drugs?&rdquo;</span><span style="font-weight: 300;"><br /></span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">The hippie's face goes white, &ldquo;no no no no.&rdquo; He puts out his hands backing away from me. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sober. I just. Uhm.&rdquo; He stammers. &ldquo;I thought I saw a pipe in your mouth earlier. I just can&rsquo;t be around that, so I had to ask.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;A pipe?&rdquo; I scoff. &ldquo;I was eating a lollipop, you glitching Narc.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;My apologies.&rdquo; The narc temples his fingers, bowing his head.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; He starts towards his house, pausing at the front walk. &ldquo;Dinner&rsquo;s not ready yet.&rdquo; The narc shrugs contritely, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;If</span></em><span style="font-weight: 300;"> you&rsquo;re staying, you can wait at the table in the yard.&rdquo; He indicates an aging pinewood picnic table, unshaded in the blazing hot sun.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a million degrees right now.&rdquo; I give my door handle a tug, checking that the lock is engaged.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come be your sober buddy inside.&rdquo; Fishing out a brown paper bag from my cross-body satchel, I stride towards his house.</span></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">The narc waves down the street at some middle aged jogger in a neon Eddie Murphy T-shirt as he props his screen door open with his back.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">My wedge sandals scrape an aged wood floor as I sidle past him into a small living room.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">I thrust the crumpled paper sack towards him, a smile dancing across my lips. &ldquo;Based on Jenna&rsquo;s description of you, I thought this might be something you&rsquo;d like&rdquo;,&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;Peeking in the bag he chuckles. &ldquo;I actually do love peanut brittle.&rdquo; He pulls out the shrink wrapped candy, admiring the nut chunks in the afternoon sunlight. &ldquo;Can I offer you a piece?&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;No&rdquo;. I eye the dollar store candy disdainfully, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all for you, man.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Frowning,&nbsp; I glance through a doorway to the right of the front entrance.</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">The floor is some red vinyl brick mess. Cabinets, canary-yellow. And there are stained white curtains covering all the windows.</span></p>
                <p><em><span style="font-weight: 300;">How can someone who&rsquo;s trying to bring the world together through dinner parties have *that* kitchen?</span></em></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">The narc strides into the gross kitchen returning with a mason jar of icy something, which he extends towards me. &ldquo;Fresh lemonade?&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <em><span style="font-weight: 300;">There&rsquo;s that alarming hospitality Jenna was talking about.&nbsp;</span></em></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Turning away from the lemonade, I glance at my cell.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Jenna texted: </span><em><span style="font-weight: 300;">Something came up at PJs dog class today. Not&nbsp; gonna make it 2nite.</span></em></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">I roll my eyes.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">The narc settles into his lumpy green sofa as my thumbs swipe across the face of my phone.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><em><span style="font-weight: 300;">J-Glitch, if you&rsquo;re going to blow me off at least don&rsquo;t be vague. WTF!?</span></em></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">The narc sets the jar of lemonade and a dish of peanut brittle on the coffee table and gestures for me to have a seat.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo; I mutter, glancing at my phone.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">No response from Jenna.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;I open my mouth to tell the narc I&rsquo;m leaving, but my voice is drowned out by the wrapping of the knocker on the front door.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">The narc bustles towards the entryway and yanks the door open, revealing a middle-aged couple, each carrying a canvas bag bulging with vegetables.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Hey guys.&rdquo; The narc hugs his guests in turn. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got a noob tonight.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Greetings Young Padawan!&rdquo; They coo at me in unison.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">I plaster on a smile, and flash them a vulcan salute.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">The woman&rsquo;s stiflingly floral perfume envelopes me as she hands off her bags to the hippy, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Carmen.&rdquo; she coos hurrying at me with outreached arms.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">I mean to duck out of the way, but a glitch buzzes from</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;my torso to my feet, gluing me in place.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">The moment my body stops pixelating, Carmen, pulls me into an embrace.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">As she steps back, her husband or whoever,&nbsp; jabs his arms towards me and grabs both my hands in both of his. &ldquo;Hi! I&rsquo;m Diego.&rdquo; His fingers are calloused like the narc&rsquo;s.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Xenia.&rdquo; I say keeping my face neutral as I hear the narc, behind me, say &ldquo;pleased to finally make your acquaintance Xenia. I&rsquo;m Jeff by the way.&rdquo;</span><span style="font-weight: 300;"><br /></span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">I smile and nod while Carmen and Diego gush about their pleasure in meeting me.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s great to meet you too Carmen and Diego.&rdquo;&nbsp; I intentionally leave out Jeff.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Did you grow those?&rdquo; I nod towards a dirt-crusted bundle of carrots protruding from a grocery bag.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;"> &ldquo;Yes!" Carmen claps her hands. "We grew everything we brought tonight. This is actually our first harvest.&rdquo; She puts her hands on Jeff&rsquo;s shoulders. &ldquo;Thanks to Mr. Green thumb here!&rdquo; </span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Diego leans toward me. &ldquo;This guy knows everything about everything. We&rsquo;ve only been coming for three months, and already we have a dang huge vegetable garden and a beautiful flock of baby chickens at our house.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re hoping to grow our little supper club too.&rdquo; Carmen effuses as she begins unpacking her grocery bag. &ldquo;Right now Diego and I are the only&rdquo; she makes air quotes &ldquo;regulars.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">Jeff puts his arm around Carmen. &ldquo;I certainly wouldn&rsquo;t call them regular. These two are a couple of oddballs.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">Diego glares at Jeff's hand draped over Carmen's shoulder.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Well this guy,&rdquo; Diego claps Jeff hard on his shoulder, pulling him away. &ldquo;This crazy guy here.&rdquo; He coos, &ldquo;Is the biggest oddball of them all.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">I follow them into the kitchen, leaning against the cabinet nearest the front exit, silently watching as they wash vegetables and chatter about how the term oddball must have originated.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Oh, I have a great idea,&rdquo; Carmen claps her hands together. &ldquo;Let's make this a themed dinner.&rdquo; She reaches for a drawer by her hip. &ldquo;We can use melon-ballers to shape these vegetables into spheres.&rdquo; She pulls out a melon baller. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be odd-ball soup!&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Jeff gushes about how brilliant Carmen&rsquo;s unnecessarily complicated plan is as he grabs a paring knife and a potato.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Minutes later a small mound of vegetable spheres has begun to form in a metal colander in the kitchen sink.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Jeff turns to Diego.&ldquo;I made this one special for you, Diego.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Craning my neck, I see Diego grinning at a bit of potato. He calls Carmen over, and she giggles and says how darling the potato lump is.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Xena look at this,&rdquo; she beckons to me.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Boards creek underfoot as I step towards Carmen. Peering down at the potato ball, which has a circle gouged out, I shrug. &ldquo;Oh. The Death Star.&rdquo; I shrug, cross my arms and go back to leaning against the cabinets.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Oh wow look at this&rdquo; Carmen coos, &ldquo;Jeff made a little potato baby yoda.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Diego brings the potato carving over and holds it in front of my face. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this amazing?&rdquo;</span><span style="font-weight: 300;"><br /></span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">I take the potato and scrutinize it. It&rsquo;s a perfect glitching Goku. I thrust the carved potato back at Diego.&ldquo;It looks like Dobby from Harry Potter.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Oh yeah!&rdquo; Jeff grabs another potato from Carmen&rsquo;s bag &ldquo;I could see that.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">Carmen hands me a melon baller. &ldquo;So what brings you here tonight Xenia?&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">I grab a freshly scrubbed carrot from the sink. &ldquo;My </span><em><span style="font-weight: 300;">former</span></em><span style="font-weight: 300;"> friend&rdquo; I mutter, &ldquo; told me to meet her here.&rdquo; Pinning the carrot against the countertop, I dig the melon baller into its dense orange flesh and twist.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;So, how&rsquo;d you and Diego hear about &ndash;&rdquo; I circle my melon baller around Jeff&rsquo;s kitchen, &ldquo;whatever this is?&rdquo;</span></p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Luke khhh phhh&rdquo; I squat down beside my five-year-old son who&rsquo;s lounging in a chair shaped like a Tie Fighter. His wide dark eyes fixed on my Darth Vader mask. &ldquo;I am your father khhh phhh.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;"> Luke giggles and kicks his feet. &ldquo;I know daddy.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">Carmen, in her flowing white Leia costume shakes her head, her clip-on leia hair-buns flapping wildly. &ldquo;Boy, Luke&rsquo;s gonna get sick of hearing that one day.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">I reach up for Carmen&rsquo;s hand, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just the dark side in you talking.&rdquo; She helps me to my feet before pushing up my mask and kissing me with a nice little bit of tongue.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">I pull away sliding my mask back down. &ldquo;khhh phhh That&rsquo;s highly inappropriate behavior khhh phhh,&rdquo; I shake my head &ldquo;considering khhh phhh I am </span><em><span style="font-weight: 300;">your </span></em><span style="font-weight: 300;">father too Leia khhh phhh.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;"> Carmen rolls her eyes. &ldquo;Diego, that&rsquo;s the grossest thing you&rsquo;ve ever said to me&rdquo;,&nbsp; she slaps my butt, &ldquo;bhuuutt it&rsquo;s no secret, Leia&rsquo;s got a predilection for incest.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">I lace my arm through hers and we both giggle.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Luke hops out of his stroller, freezing and pixelating briefly, before giving two swift tugs on the back of my Vader cape. &ldquo;Daddy,&rdquo; He gazes up at me, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s a prediction for insess?&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">I take his tiny hand as we begin strolling towards the back of the line to take a picture with a life sized Java The Hut mannequin. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Game of Thrones Stuff son.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Luke halts, drops my hand and peers up at me. &ldquo;Ooh.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Luke was scared to death one Sunday night when he walked in on Carmen and I, streaming a classic episode of G.O.T.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">He&rsquo;s not a kid who likes violence, so now whenever we don&rsquo;t want him to pay attention to something, we just say it&rsquo;s Game of Thrones Stuff and he stops asking questions.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">I reach down and take Luke&rsquo;s hand again. When I look up, a blonde woman dressed in a brown furry bodysuit with face painted brown and black, is wandering over to Carmen.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Mam, I was watching y&rsquo;all and I just have to say,&rdquo; she drawls. &ldquo;Your son is just plain adorable with his little lightsaber and all.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Carmen freezes.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo; I give Carmen&rsquo;s &ndash; very tense &ndash; shoulder a squeeze. &ldquo;Your costume&rsquo;s hella cool too.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;The Chewbacca lady smiles at me before turning back to Carmen. &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s okay with his mom and dad,&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">I wince as I hear Carmen suck in her breath.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">The Chewbacca lady squats down in front of Luke. &ldquo;I know a green jedi master who would just love to see what the future holds for this little padawan.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">I can see Carmen fighting back tears as she says: &ldquo;We were actually just leaving.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Seeing Carmen&rsquo;s distress, the Chewbacca lady starts petting the fur on her arm. &ldquo;Well.&rdquo; She turns away from us, &ldquo;May the fourth be with y&rsquo;all.&rdquo; Hurriedly, she strides back towards the Yoda fortune-telling booth across the convention floor.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">I glance down at Luke, happily playing with his lightsaber. Then my eyes drift back up to Carmen, tears silently sliding down her cheeks.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Taking her hand, I lean close to her, so that Luke can&rsquo;t hear. &ldquo;I know it hurts you that you and I don&rsquo;t have kids and I know Gina is really rude to you about spending time with him, but Luke loves you I love you... so so much.&rdquo; I kiss the top of her head.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;"> Carmen&rsquo;s long white sleeve brushes over Luke&rsquo;s hair, sending him into a giggle fit as she dabs her eye. &ldquo;C&rsquo;mon Diego, let&rsquo;s just go.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><strong>2042-08-22T16:40:41PST|b54ba8fb-01fa-496e-b97c-e3aaef3fb11a|&lsquo;Outside the convention</strong><span style="font-weight: 300;">&rsquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">As we approach the Powell street BART station, Carmen nudges me with her elbow and nods at a white GM van, parked in a loading dock beside us. &ldquo;Diego, go to that website on your phone.&rdquo; She points to a giant QR code on the side of the van.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><strong>2042-08-22T16:47:41PST|b54ba8fb-01fa-496e-b97c-e3aaef3fb11a|&lsquo;After dropping Luke with his mom</strong><span style="font-weight: 300;">&rsquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">A jogger in a hot pink Eddie Murphy T shirt trots by as I ease my green Subaru Outback to a stop beside a row of liquid amber trees on a quiet suburban street in Fremont. &ldquo;Oh wow, babe,&rdquo; Carmen points, &ldquo;The force is strong with whoever planted that garden.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">Turning to where Carmen is pointing I hear my seat belt retract into its holster as I&rsquo;m transfixed by the bountiful front yard across from us.</span><span style="font-weight: 300;"><br /></span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">Wood-bordered garden beds, bursting with sprouting vegetables surround a long, split-log picnic table in the middle of a crushed gravel clearing.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">All my life, until eight months ago when I bought my first house, I lived in one apartment or another around the Bay Area. I&rsquo;ve had some impressive herb gardens on apartment balconies and I&rsquo;ve grown a decent potted tomato plant or a cucumber vine a few times, but the one thing that I have always really wanted is just a big ol&rsquo; home garden with enough vegetables and fruits to feed my family. I want Luke to have fresh clean produce every day.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Come on slowpoke&rdquo; Carmen waves at me from across the street.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Fishing my cell out of my pocket,&nbsp; I hurry out of the car.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Smile Carmen&rdquo; I coo as I snap a quick pic.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Shoving my phone back in my front pocket I chirp my car lock and stride across the street, taking Carmen&rsquo;s hand as we wander up the gravel path to a solid oak door.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Check out the knocker on this one&rdquo; Carmen elbows me jovially as she hammers the gleaming chrome door knocker.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">I let out a hearty laugh. &ldquo;Nothing on you though babe.&rdquo; I kiss her wiry hair and sigh in the smell of flowers and fruit.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">The door lurches open with a loud creak.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">A broad shouldered man about my age or maybe in his later forties waves us in.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Hi you!&rdquo; He smiles at my wife with a note of familiarity. &ldquo;Carmen?&rdquo;.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Yes. Hi!&rdquo; Carmen titters. &ldquo;We spoke on the phone.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Grinning, she marches over and embraces our new friend. &ldquo;Good to meet you Jeff.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">As Carmen steps back, I jaunt over and offer up a handshake . &ldquo;May the fourth be with you.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;And also with you.&rdquo; Jeff chuckles.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;It smells delicious in here,&rdquo; Carmen coos as she sets her purse on the green corduroy sofa, beside the front door.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo; Pride sweeps over Jeff&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;I put a chili cornbread casserole in the oven about twenty minutes ago.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><strong>2042-08-22T18:52:41PST|b54ba8fb-01fa-496e-b97c-e3aaef3fb11a|&lsquo;later, things get spicy</strong><span style="font-weight: 300;">&rsquo;</span><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">We&rsquo;re sitting on Jeff&rsquo;s couch watching his dog, Spice Rack, show off tricks when the oven timer dings.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Jeff rises from the couch,&nbsp; &ldquo;Can you two take the plates and silverware out to the picnic table while I grab the casserole and put <i>my spicy boy</i>,&rdquo; Jeff puppy-talks as the dog wriggles and bounces on its front paws. &ldquo;into my bedroom?&ldquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;No problem.&rdquo; I grab the stack of brown ceramic dishes and a coffee can, filled with silverware from Jeff&rsquo;s kitchen counter.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Hey, Diggy!&rdquo; Carmen swats my shoulder with the napkins she's carrying, &ldquo;can you grab the Salt and pepper from Jeff&rsquo;s dining room?&rdquo; </span><span style="font-weight: 300;"><br /></span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;You got it babe!&rdquo; I run back inside, passing Jeff as he exits with the casserole.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think there actually is a dining room.&rdquo; I call out to no one in particular as I wander back into the kitchen and begin rummaging through Jeff&rsquo;s cabinets.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Grabbling a blue Morton salt canister, I trot outside.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t find any pepp&hellip;&rdquo; My gut clenches as I peer across the front yard.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Jeff and Carmen, bodies angled towards one another, turn away, suddenly silent.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Taking a deep, calming breath, I stride past the front garden beds towards the table.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Pursing my lips, I slam the salt canister down on the table directly in front of a set of ceramic salt and pepper shakers.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Jeff scoots away from Carmen &ldquo;Sorry man, did you want to sit next to your wife?&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;We were just realizing,&rdquo; He starts to get up.&nbsp; &ldquo;We used to play World of Warcraft together.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">I&rsquo;m silent as my eyes shift from Jeff to Carmen and back.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">I take a deep breath. &ldquo;No you&rsquo;re fine.&rdquo; I force a smile as I gesture for Jeff to sit back down.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;I like to look at Carmen while I eat anyway.&rdquo; I wink at my wife.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">She lets out a nervous giggle and winks back as I slide onto the bench across from her.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Jeff nods at my &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a droid, you're a droid&rdquo; t-shirt &ldquo;So, what&rsquo;s your favorite Star Wars movie, Diego?&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">While we wait for dinner to cool, the three of us fall easily into a conversation laced with Star Wars philosophy, tips on urban food foraging, and an impromptu sing-a-long of Mr. Roboto.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">By the time our host begins dishing gobs of casserole onto our plates, we&rsquo;re heaping heavier topics onto our conversation.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;The world&rsquo;s in this pickle.&rdquo; Jeff scrapes up the last forkful of beans and cheese from his plate.&nbsp; &ldquo;Corporations are bound to shareholders to make money,&rdquo; He rolls her eyes, &ldquo;and marketing departments have figured out that if they stir up anxiety, they get clicks and make bucks.&rdquo; He rubs his thumb and index fingers.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true, the web&rsquo;s like straight up Tatooine right now.&rdquo; Carmen shoots me a coy smile.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">I chuckle, winking at my wife. I love when she finds little ways to bring Star Wars into things.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;I think with globalization,&rdquo; Jeff sets down his fork, &ldquo;most people are just put upon to do too much for too many.&rdquo; He shakes his head. &ldquo;Sure, everyone&rsquo;s interacting all the time, but the scale is too big.&rdquo; He drops his napkin on his empty plate. &ldquo;Nurses have too many patients to give the care they&rsquo;d like, teachers have too many students to help every kid fulfill their potential.&rdquo; He rises, picking up his plate. &ldquo;We treat everyone outside our social sphere like they&rsquo;re just non-persons in some video game we&rsquo;re playing.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><strong>2042-08-22T19:17:53PST|b54ba8fb-01fa-496e-b97c-e3aaef3fb11a|&lsquo;back to oddball soup</strong><span style="font-weight: 300;">&rsquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">I shrug as I finish my story for Xenia. &ldquo;I definitely feel like a nonperson more and more these days.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Grabbing Jeff&rsquo;s yellow, stain-covered oven mitts, I follow Xenia out front with the steaming pot of oddball soup.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;So is Luke just at home kicking back with some beers and babes right now or what?&rdquo; She teases, sliding onto the picnic bench.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">Easing one of the oven mitts off underneath the soup pot, I set it in the center of the picnic table.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;No&rdquo; I glance nervously back at Carmen, who&rsquo;s exiting Jeff&rsquo;s house.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Lukes-mom-doesnt-want-Luke-coming-here.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Carmen is walking out the front door carrying a cutting board with cornbread and butter.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">I lean towards Xenia. &ldquo;It-upsets -Carmen-Don&rsquo;t-bring-it-up.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Straightening, I smile at my wife.&nbsp; &ldquo;Need me to grab anything else babe?&rdquo;</span><span style="font-weight: 300;"><br /></span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">Jeff trudges out of the house carrying his ceramic salt and pepper shakers. &ldquo;I think we&rsquo;ve got it all Diggy&rdquo; He teases me.</span></p>

                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">Pajama tugs me,&nbsp; by his leash, across the yellowing lawn of Fairway Park towards a flock of pigeons. Dozens of gray birds swirl in the air around us as Pajama continues his relentless charge forward. Shielding my face with my left arm I stumble over Pajama, whose nose is rammed under the tail of a stark black German Shepherd, coat glistening in the sunlight like a supermodel&rsquo;s hair in a Shampoo commercial.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;No Pajama!&rdquo; I jerk on his leash as I stagger to an awkward halt, &ldquo;Leave him alone&rdquo;</span><em><span style="font-weight: 300;">. </span></em><span style="font-weight: 300;">Ignoring me, Pajama follows behind the Shepard, nose glued to its crotch, as the black dog wanders behind me and takes an unnaturally long sniff of my butt.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Stepping away from the Shepard, I kneel down and pull Pajama by the collar.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">He growls.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">I release his collar.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">I&rsquo;m so fixated on the dogs that I jump when the man holding the German Shepherd&rsquo;s leash laughs. &ldquo;Looks like you&rsquo;re here for obedience school.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Sorry about that.&rdquo; My eyes follow the Shepherd&rsquo;s neon yellow and white checkered leash up the tanned hand holding it, up past the neon yellow and white checkered &ldquo;dog days of summer&rdquo; fanny pack , up past the white t-shirt that&rsquo;s fighting to restrain a pair of perfect pecs, past a gorgeously chiseled stubbled jaw to a pair of beautiful seafoam eyes.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">I swallow hard. &ldquo;What kind of shampoo does your dog use?&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;We shower together.,&rdquo; The man tosses his sandy blond locks. &ldquo;And we use Malibu C Shampoo.&rdquo; His surfer bro laugh rings through the air.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">My mouth drops as I&rsquo;m transported to this man&rsquo;s perfect stone tiled open floor plan bathroom, watching water cascade down his chiseled body as he squats to lather up his Petsmart commercial of a dog.</span></p>
                <p><em><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span></em> <span style="font-weight: 300;">The man clears his throat extending a hand towards me. &ldquo; I&rsquo;m Myka. And this,&rdquo; He gestures toward the movie star dog, who is now sitting at perfect attention by his side while PJ enthusiastically humps him, &ldquo;Is Max. We&rsquo;re </span><em><span style="font-weight: 300;">pet-</span></em><span style="font-weight: 300;">ucational instructors for Pooch you in your place.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><em><span style="font-weight: 300;">His puns are almost as delicious as his pecks.</span></em></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">PJ and Max fuse together, a momentary mosaic of pixels. I eye Myka apologetically as we wait for the glitch to pass.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been such a glitchy week.&rdquo; Myka rolls his eyes.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Tell me about it.&rdquo; I shake my head as the dogs reanimate and Max lowers himself to an attentive seated position while Pajama lunges towards Myka&rsquo;s fanny pack.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&rdquo;Down, PJ,&rdquo; I yell, yanking at his leash. &ldquo;By the way. This is Pajama.&rdquo; PJ growls as I tug him away. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m Jenna.&rdquo; I push Pajama&rsquo;s butt down, forcing him into an awkward half squating half seated position. &ldquo;We shower separately.&rdquo; I grin.</span></p>
                <p><em><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span></em> <span style="font-weight: 300;">Myka and Max stroll over to a nearby picnic table and return seconds later with a clipboard of paperwork that says Pajama Carson on top.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;I like your dog&rsquo;s name. &rdquo; Myka extends the clipboard towards me.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo; I take the paperwork from him. &rdquo;I like your puns.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Thanks. They&rsquo;re usually lost on the ladies. He nudges me in what may, possibly, be a flirtatious way as he steps past me towards a small white fluffy dog and its short middle aged pet mom.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><em><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span></em> <span style="font-weight: 300;">I fight the urge to fawn over my Myka-touched arm and instead slide a pen from the clipboard clip and start on Pajama&rsquo;s forms. It only takes about five minutes of dog Q&amp;A before I realize I don&rsquo;t actually know anything about my dog&ndash; or dogs in general, so I&rsquo;m feeling a bit panicked when Myka comes back to ask if I have any questions about the class.</span><span style="font-weight: 300;"><br /></span> <em><span style="font-weight: 300;">Well for one thing I&rsquo;d like to know what in the actual glitch an anal gland is and why the hell would anyone want to&ndash; express it?</span></em><span style="font-weight: 300;"><br /></span> <span style="font-weight: 300;"> &ldquo;Sorry what?&rdquo; I ask him as I scan the park for any topic of conversation that won&rsquo;t make me sound completely ignorant.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Jenna.&rdquo; Myka is speaking insultingly loud and slow now. &ldquo; Do&hellip; you&hellip; have&hellip; any&hellip; questions?&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">I catch a whiff of weed smoke on the breeze and my eyes search out a lanky girl smoking a joint and stalking across the park wearing a yellow flower print dress, torn fishnets and combat boots.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Geeze look at that hipster.&rdquo; I scoff.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;"> Myka&rsquo;s brow furrows. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s a hipster?&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;"> &ldquo;You know.&rdquo; I shrug. &ldquo;People like&rdquo; I point. &ldquo;that girl.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;"> He cocks his head inquisitively. Max follows suit.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">The girl is scowling in my direction now.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">My cheeks grow hot.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><em><span style="font-weight: 300;">How do I describe a hipster to someone who doesn&rsquo;t just know one when they see one?</span></em></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">Myka&rsquo;s face remains blank. &ldquo;You were saying. That girl is a hipster </span><em><span style="font-weight: 300;">because</span></em><span style="font-weight: 300;">?&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><em><span style="font-weight: 300;">What the hell even is a hipster? Do I even know?</span></em></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;What?&rdquo; I stall for time, sliding my cell from my pocket.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">As he repeats the question, I lowkey navigate to Urban dictionary.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Oh. Sorry.&rdquo; I chuckle. &ldquo;I thought you said what is a quip shirt.&rdquo; My fingers dart across my phone&rsquo;s keypad. &ldquo;And I was like. I don&rsquo;t know, but I want one.&rdquo; I laugh harder and faker, as I skim through the text on my phone, growing more and more confused about what a hipster actually is. &ldquo;I was thinking maybe a quip shirt would be like a t-shirt with a funny slogan.&rdquo; The definition of hipster has to be 5000 words long.&nbsp; I give up and slide my phone back in my front pocket. &ldquo;but yeah, a hip-stir</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">is like when you dance like you&rsquo;re hula hooping but you&rsquo;re not.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh yeah. I </span><em><span style="font-weight: 300;">do</span></em><span style="font-weight: 300;"> know what a hip stir is.&rdquo; Myka swivels his hips. &ldquo;My wife actually compliments me on my hip stir all the time.&rdquo; He flashes me a grin.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">I freeze mesmerized by his perfect teeth. His perfect </span><em><span style="font-weight: 300;">married </span></em><span style="font-weight: 300;">teeth.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">I try to keep the pep in my voice. &ldquo;Yeah. My boyfriend&rsquo;s got a good one too.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><em><span style="font-weight: 300;">Why do I keep telling people that I have a boyfriend?</span></em></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">We both laugh awkwardly for a little too long. We&rsquo;re both definitely uncomfortable now.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">I&rsquo;m fiddling with Pajama&rsquo;s leash, mentally cobbling together a story about a vacation with my non-existent boyfriend last fall, when Myka looks directly in my eyes. &ldquo;I do know what a hipster is.&rdquo; He reaches over and gives my shoulder a light squeeze. &rdquo;I was just glitching with you.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">He&rsquo;s let go of my shoulder but I can still feel the warmth of his hand there.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">My brain is effervescent.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">Lots of people with dogs have begun to drift towards Myka, so he turns away from me and walks back over to the clipboard table. I watch him wander over to each dog, introducing himself, handing dog owners clipboards, relaying stories about the search and rescue work he and Max do and complimenting every owner on his or her adorable dog.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;I feel Pajama tug on his leash. He&rsquo;s creeping towards a nearby retriever who is growling, so I start tugging PJ in the opposite direction.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">I finally manage to get him to a space where we can see and hear Myka, while maintaining a safe distance from Pajama&rsquo;s classmates.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">Squatting next to PJ, my voice assumes that puppy-talk tone I used to hate, &ldquo;Hee diin tell mee whaa a cuute doggo I haave, huh PJ?&rdquo; I scratch Pajama behind his ear.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">Pajama&rsquo;s eyes meet mine for a split second before he begins licking his crotch.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">Rolling my eyes, I rise to my feet.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Myka is walking towards me.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;By the way.&rdquo; He grins, lowering his voice, &ldquo;I do private lessons too if you and Pajama ever need some extra help.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">My face flushes as he fishes a business card from his fanny pack.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">Extending it towards me, his fingers brush the side of my hand and tingles radiate up my arm.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Myka is launching into a story about a search and rescue mission he did in Sycamore Canyon.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">My skin is pulsating with heat.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">He&rsquo;s saying a car had gone off the side of the road but a dog survived. I squint, struggling to focus on his moving lips.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">The dog ran away.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">He sounds distant.</span></p>
                <p><em><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;I need to sit.&nbsp;</span></em></p>
                <p><em><span style="font-weight: 300;">No</span></em></p>
                <p><em><span style="font-weight: 300;">It's my turn for rescue stories and dog compliments.</span></em></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <em><span style="font-weight: 300;">I don&rsquo;t want him to think I&rsquo;m ru&hellip;</span></em></p>

                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;"> &ldquo;Jenna. Jenna. You alright?&rdquo; Pajama is licking my face </span><em><span style="font-weight: 300;">and talking to me?</span></em></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">He looks like he&rsquo;s just standing there panting, but he says &ldquo;Oh thank god you're alive&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><em><span style="font-weight: 300;">Whoa! I&rsquo;m telepathic with dogs</span></em><span style="font-weight: 300;">!</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">Myka&rsquo;s face comes into focus. He&rsquo;s&nbsp; holding Pajama by the collar and squatting beside me.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">I raise my head, picking a twig from my hair.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">My elbow stings. I touch it and feel warm blood trickling down my arm. &ldquo;That was embarrassing.&rdquo; I clasp my bleeding elbow.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Myka looks alarmed.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a big deal.&rdquo; blood dibbles down my arm. &ldquo;I have </span><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/vasovagal-syncope/symptoms-causes/syc-20350527#:~:text=Vasovagal%20syncope%20(vay%2Dzoh%2D,blood%20pressure%20to%20drop%20suddenly."><span style="font-weight: 300;">vasovagal syncope</span></a><span style="font-weight: 300;">.&rdquo;</span><span style="font-weight: 300;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 300;">Myka&rsquo;s brow furrows. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what that is, but I think you might need stitches.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Reaching my hand behind my neck, I extend my arm, and peer down my elbow.</span></p>
                <p><em><span style="font-weight: 300;">Oh God. That is bad</span></em></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">I feel myself falling and everything goes black.&nbsp;</span></p>

                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Half rising from the picnic bench, I peer into the pot at the center of the table. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 300;">Empty - Damn!</span></em></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;This was some baller soup!&rdquo; I enthuse to no one in particular.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Everyone looks up from Jenna&rsquo;s fiasco of a dog long enough to laugh politely at my pun.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Jeff clears his throat.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was going to go out back to pick some fresh peaches from my tree for dessert.&rdquo; He grins. &ldquo;And maybe whip up some heavy cream to go on top.&rdquo; He rises from the picnic bench, &ldquo;Since you&rsquo;re done Xenia, would you like to come help harvest some peaches from my backyard?&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;As long as,&rdquo; I make air quotes, &ldquo;Harvesting peaches, isn&rsquo;t some kind of euphemism&rdquo;, I eye Jeff suspiciously. &ldquo;Then sure, I&rsquo;d love to get my hands on your fuzzy lil&rsquo; peaches.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Chuckling, Jeff shakes his head and offers me a hand up from the picnic bench.</span><span style="font-weight: 300;"><br /></span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Diego,&rdquo; Carmen stacks her empty soup bowl on top of her husband&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Can you clean up the soup bowls and make whipped cream while Jeff and Xenia get the peaches washed and sliced.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Bossy-pants Carmen squats down in front of Pajama. &ldquo;Jenna and I can take this guy for a walk around the block to let out some of his zoomy energy.&rdquo; She pushes Pajama down as he pounces on her shoulders and slimes her face with his tongue.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">I follow Jeff across his front-farm and through a side gate to his Harvest Moon backyard.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">It&rsquo;s not a big yard, maybe a couple thousand square feet, but it&rsquo;s like something out of a farming RPG video game.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Most of the yard is an out of control lush garden: tomatoes and cucumbers hanging from arched trellises above clusters of lettuce, beans, and herbs.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Corn and sunflowers jutting up here and there from dense masses of vegetables and a small flock of white, happily clucking chickens peck and scratch the dirt in a fenced-in enclosure at the far back corner of the yard.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Across from the gate where we entered, in the nearest corner, water splashes and cascades down a rocky waterfall into a stone-bordered coy pond.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Trotting over to the pond, I admire a small school of bright orange and white spotted fish swirling beneath a dozen varieties of vibrant water plants.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Across from the pond, backing up to the house, a woven hammock is strung between a peach tree and a cherry tree which border a small shaggy lawn. </span><span style="font-weight: 300;"><br /></span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">I holler at Jeff, who is standing beside the peach tree, &ldquo;Are you kidding me with this perfect lil&rsquo; pastoral&nbsp; Zen garden?&rdquo; I gesticulate toward the lawn with both hands. &ldquo;It looks like there should be a glitching unicorn standing there or something.&rdquo;</span><span style="font-weight: 300;"><br /></span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">Jeff chuckles cautiously. &ldquo;Th</span><em><span style="font-weight: 300;">aaan</span></em><span style="font-weight: 300;">ks?&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a complim&ndash;&rdquo; I&rsquo;m seized with surprise as a black rock by the waterfall sprouts a head&hellip; and wings&hellip; and shakes itself&hellip; and&hellip; oh&hellip; my heart calms as I realize it&rsquo;s just a black chicken who&rsquo;d been napping in the dirt by the pond.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Shaking dust from her lustrous black feathers she waddles down the rocky embankment to the pond. </span><span style="font-weight: 300;"><br /></span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Aww how cute.&rdquo; I coo as she dips her head, scooping up a beakful of water before throwing her head back and gargling it down.</span><span style="font-weight: 300;"><br /></span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">Jeff points at the small black chicken as he walks over to me. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Aya, she&rsquo;s a cool bird, huh.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Yeah, she&rsquo;s a real Betty&rdquo; I shrug, &ldquo;but you gave her the wrong name.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Oh?,&rdquo; Jeff raises his brows. &ldquo;What&rsquo;d she tell you her name should be?&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get so excited Jefe.&rdquo; I chuckle.&nbsp; &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t commune with your chicken or something.&rdquo; I tuck a falling curl behind my ear &ldquo;She just looks like her name should be Rocky.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; He shades his eyes, peering down at me.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;&ldquo;Because&rdquo; My cheeks flush.&nbsp; &ldquo;I thought she was a rock.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Must be some bird-looking rocks where you come from.&rdquo; Jeff laughs.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;So, why&rsquo;d you name her,&rdquo; I make air quotes. &ldquo;Aya?&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Jeff grins. &ldquo;Most of my chickens are white Leghorns that I bought online.&rdquo; He pulls out his cell phone and begins thumb punching the password screen, &ldquo;but Aya&rsquo;s a rare breed from Indonesia called Ayam Cemani&rdquo; He swivels his phone screen towards me, &ldquo;and I&ndash;uuhhh actually won her in a poker game.&rdquo; </span><span style="font-weight: 300;"><br /></span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">His phone&rsquo;s wallpaper is an image of Aya standing atop of a pile of random trinkets on a green felt table.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;I won her from my neighbor Cheryl during a monthly bartering poker game thing she hosts.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Cheryl sounds fun&rdquo; I grin.</span><span style="font-weight: 300;"><br /></span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">I hear a sliding glass door whoosh open and Diego&rsquo;s face appears above the top of a cluster of tomato plants.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;&ldquo;Hey friends,&rdquo; He jangles a canvas bag over his head, &ldquo; I thought you might want a bag to carry the peaches.&rdquo;</span><span style="font-weight: 300;"><br /></span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Good thought.&rdquo; Jeff waives at Diego. </span><span style="font-weight: 300;"><br /></span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">Diego glances back at something inside the house then turns to Jeff. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have Spice Rack bring it out for you.&rdquo; He holds the bag still. &ldquo;I bet even ZEN-YUH will get a kick out of Old Spicey.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">I hear a clamor of claws on wood, then a massive, mahogany dog bounds past Diego, snatching the bag out of his hand and rushing over to Jeff. </span><span style="font-weight: 300;"><br /></span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">Jeff grabs the bag from the dog&rsquo;s mouth slipping the handle over his shoulder. &ldquo;Good. Boy Spice Rack!&rdquo; He holds up both his hands towards the dog.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">The big dog jovially springs on to his hind legs and then steadies himself before ever-so-gently touching the pads of his paws to Jeff&rsquo;s hands and dropping to an expectant sitting position at Jeff&rsquo;s feet.</span><span style="font-weight: 300;"><br /></span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">Plugging his hand into the tree beside him, Jeff grabs a peach, fish hooks it with his pointer finger, and wretches out the pit&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Juice oozes down his arm as he tosses the pitted peach at Spice Rack, who leaps up, gingerly catches it mid air and trots silently back towards the house.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">When the dog reaches the back slider, he jumps up, presses his paws against the glass and uses his weight to ease it open and then he actually closes the door from the inside after himself.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Wow.&rdquo; I tip my head at Jeff. &ldquo;You should help Jenna with her dog.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Sliding my hands into my back pockets, I start slowly chicken-walking towards Jeff.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;How did I not know about all the magnificent beasts that inhabit your woods Jefe?&rdquo; I stop directly beside Jeff and nudge him with my chicken-winged-elbow.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Jeff steps back from me. &ldquo;Let's grab some of these peaches.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Are we in a rush?&rdquo; I wander over to the coy pond. &ldquo;I want to check out your yard more.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Aya clucks and flutters away as I seat myself on a smooth rock by the waterfall.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&rdquo;What do you do for a living Jefe?&rdquo; I raise my hand to my brow to shade my view of his face. &ldquo;Are you &ndash; someone&rsquo;s Jefe?&rdquo;</span><span style="font-weight: 300;"><br /></span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">Jeff chuckles &ldquo;No. I don&rsquo;t have any employees.&rdquo; He looks down, rubbing the back of his neck. &ldquo;Right now I&rsquo;m just getting by.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">My eyebrows raise. &ldquo;So you don&rsquo;t work.&rdquo; I rise to my feet. &ldquo;But you drive a big white van around with a QR code, luring people to your house.&rdquo; I suck my teeth. &ldquo;creepy.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Jeff tosses the canvas bag at me. &ldquo;We shouldn&rsquo;t need more than a dozen peaches&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">I roll my eyes as I snatch the bag up from the ground in front of me. &ldquo;I thought you weren&rsquo;t trying to be anyone&rsquo;s jefe, Jefe.&rdquo;</span><span style="font-weight: 300;"><br /></span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">Jeff shakes his head as he walks away.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going inside to make sure Diego has everything he needs for the whipped cream.&rdquo;</span><span style="font-weight: 300;"><br /></span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">My gut clenches as he disappears through his back sliding door.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Sighing, I look down at the empty bag in my hands. Peaches do sound kinda good right now.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">As I wander closer to the nearest tree, it smells like I&rsquo;m walking into a Bath and Body Works.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Plucking a plump fuzzy orb, I brush it against my cheek. Velvet perfume heaven.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Nectar runs down my jaw as I sink my teeth into fresh dew and sunshine.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">I&rsquo;m well past twenty peaches in the bag and two in my stomach when I hear Jenna yell: &ldquo;Nononono Pajama stop!&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Two dogs erupt into a bark fit inside the house and then, *smack*.&nbsp; The back slider shimmies as Pajama collides with it.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">I watch, stupefied, through the back door as Jeff sweeps Spice Rack up over his shoulders in a fireman&rsquo;s carry, leaps over Pajama, opens the slider, bounds outside, and whooshes the door shut behind himself and Spice Rack.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Pajama, snarling and barking, leaps up and throws himself against the glass as Jeff reaches above the door frame, retrieves a metal house key and locks the sliding door.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;Grabbing a fistfull of dog leashes from a hook beside the back slider, he squats stoope and leashes Spice Rack with a click.</span><span style="font-weight: 300;"><br /></span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;What the glitch just happened?&rdquo; My eyes are wide.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Without responding, Jeff blurs past me, speeding towards the gate to the front yard.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Jeff throws the gate open and I see Jenna, Carmen and Diego running from the front of the house towards the back yard.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Dropping the bag of peaches, scattering fruit across the lawn, I jog over to join them.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">As I approach, Jenna throws her sweaty arms around me pulling me into a snotty teary hug. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I will ever get Pajama under control&rdquo; she sobs.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be fine Jenna,&rdquo; pinching the corner of my white t-shirt between my fingers, I wipe a glob of Jenna&rsquo;s snot off my cheek.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get a house together.&rdquo; I grin at my friend. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll help you with PJ.&rdquo; I dab at Jenna&rsquo;s teary cheek. &ldquo;I want to grow peaches and get a chicken named Rocky.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;You know&rdquo;, Diego leans over my shoulder, &ldquo;Carmen just got her real estate license.&rdquo;</span></p>

                </p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;"><br /></span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;I never get to sit back here&rdquo; I graze my fingertips across the plush beige arm rest in the back seat of Carmen&rsquo;s 95 Crown Victoria. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nice!&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Carmen tips her rearview mirror down, so she can see me behind her. &ldquo;I take care of my Vickie,&rdquo; she winks at me, &ldquo;and she takes care of me.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Aww, Vickie, I like that name!&rdquo; Jenna, who&rsquo;s squeezed in between Carmen and Xenia on the split-bench seat up front, pats Vickie&rsquo;s spotlessly clean dashboard.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Xenia rifles through a stack of real estate fliers in her lap &ldquo;Was that all?&rdquo; She scoffs at Carmen.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Yeah. I know none of them had everything on your list.&rdquo; Carmen sighs.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Carmen was up all night painstakingly combing through listings to find the perfect home for these girls, but every house today seemed to be wrong for one reason or another.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Jeff, seated next to me, pokes his head between Jenna and Xenia, &ldquo;Maybe we could jack hammer out the concrete from the last backyard.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <strong>2042-08-30T16:58:54PST|b54ba8fb-01fa-496e-b97c-e3aaef3fb11a|&lsquo;driving back to Jeff\&rsquo;s&rsquo;</strong><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">We come upon a row of massive eucalyptus trees towering over the road for at least a quarter of a mile. Towards the center of the line of trees there&rsquo;s a giant white sign with red hand painted lettering:</span></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">For Sale By Owner As Is.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">10 Acres. Farm House Included.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;Major Fixer Upper Opportunity&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;650-555-5555</span></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Text.&rdquo; Xenia claps. &ldquo;That.&rdquo; she claps. &ldquo;Owner.&rdquo; Xenia and Jenna descend into a shrieking giggle fit as Carmen pulls to the side of the road and begins typing on her phone. </span><span style="font-weight: 300;"><br /></span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">Carmen turns to the girls beside her. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost 5:00. Do you want to wait here to see if we get a response or come back another day?&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Now!&rdquo; Jenna squeals.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Ten minutes pass with no response, so we decide to drive down the gravel driveway at the end of the row of trees and see if anyone is home.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">As Carmen creeps Vickie past the wall of Eucalyptus, I am awe-struck by the sight of a sprawling field of sunflowers, every one of them well over ten feet high with bright yellow heads bowing under the weight of their seeds.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;&nbsp;Directly in front of the sunflower field is a run down farmhouse with a warped and splintering wrap around porch.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Sparse flecks of white paint clinging to the decaying wood siding and dusty cobwebbed ceiling. I peer out the windshield at the house&rsquo;s yellowed thinning glass front windows, but I can only see darkness inside.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Carmen pulls to a stop just in front of the porch steps and Xenia and Jenna launch themselves at the house chattering excitedly about how much they could do here.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;Easing open my door I stretch my stiff limbs and climb out behind Jeff and Carmen and we amble towards Xenia and Jenna on the front porch of the farmhouse.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Carmen&rsquo;s phone buzzes. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the seller&rsquo;s realtor!&rdquo; She thumbs her phone screen. &ldquo;Oh that&rsquo;s cute,&rdquo; she turns to me, &ldquo;the code is </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1138_(number)"><span style="font-weight: 300;">1138</span></a><span style="font-weight: 300;">.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re cute.&rdquo; I chuckle as I sidle over and give her butt a pat.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s annoying!&rdquo; Carmen huffs.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">I go rigid. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 300;">Carmen usually loves when I touch her butt.</span></em></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;No. Not you.&rdquo; She pecks my cheek. &ldquo;The lock box is back at the mailboxes a couple miles down the road.&rdquo; She squints at the group of us standing by the farmhouse door. &ldquo;Do you guys want to poke around outside here while I drive back and get the key?&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Hell yeah!&rdquo; Xenia grabs Jenna&rsquo;s hand and the pair skip towards an </span><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/fisherbray/52645284690"><span style="font-weight: 300;">old green John Deer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 300;"> tractor beside the farmhouse, a single-seater with a rusting exhaust pipe and wheels almost as tall as me.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">I hug Carmen from behind. &ldquo;Jeff and I will stay here and make sure those girls don&rsquo;t get hurt on that tractor.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Sounds good.&rdquo; Carmen climbs back into her car. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be right back.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">As Jeff and I wave to the cloud of dust rising behind Carmen's departing car, I feel two swift tugs on the back of my shirt.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">I freeze. &ldquo;Luke?&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Whirling around, I see not Luke, but a strange bedraggled preschooler in threadbare blue jeans and a ripped white t-shirt.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Mister,&rdquo; he implores faintly, &ldquo;can you help me get a peach?&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Hi there little friend.&rdquo; Jeff eyes the child with concern, &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have a peach. Are you hungry?&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">The boy&rsquo;s eyes water and his entire body pixelates and reforms as he pleads, &ldquo;I need a peach.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Turning on his heel, the boy sprints past the farmhouse towards a tree that must be three stories tall, growing at the edge of the sunflower field.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Jeff and I dart after the boy.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">As we near the tree, I slow and gawk at a massive pile of ripped leaves and peach pits beneath its bare branches. There&rsquo;s just one plump peach left thirty feet above us, at the top of the barren tree.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Jeff&rsquo;s shin deep wading through the leaves towards the child when the kid launches himself at the lowest branch and hoists himself up.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">The bedraggled child stands on the branch, reaching for the next limb. As he hoists himself up once more, a flock of giant black chickens erupt all around from the sunflower field, frantically fluttering up into the naked tree branches.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;That looks like an entire flock of Ayam Cemani chickens.&rdquo; Jeff turns to me. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s like ten thousand dollars worth of poultry right there.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">I narrow my eyes at Jeff. &ldquo;Who cares what they&rsquo;re worth.&rdquo; My brow furrows &ldquo;Why did they just flock like that?&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Come down kid.&rdquo; Jeff shouts. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re gonna to get hurt&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">The bedraggled child is halfway to the top now and the chickens are relentlessly pecking him.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">The boy shrieks as his grip slips.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">He crashes down, branches snapping and cracking, as he falls through a gauntlet of bare limbs.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Shielding my face from the shower of twigs and dust, I hear the soft thump of the child landing in a pile of leaves between Jeff and I.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">We both spring to action, pulling leaves and sticks off the boy as we scramble to visually assess his physical state.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">The child, who is now gashed and bleeding, bolts upright, red blood staining his clothes as he runs straight back to the base of the peach tree.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Stay down here kid?&rdquo; Jeff halts the boy holding him by his shoulders. &ldquo;I think those chickens must have a nest in that tree or something.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">I shuffle towards Jeff and the boy &ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s rabies.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Mister.&rdquo; The kid glares at me. &ldquo;I just need that peach.&rdquo; He jumps and grabs the nearest branch.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Jeff lifts the kid off the branch and sets him atop the leaf pile. Resting a firm hand on the boy&rsquo;s shoulder to hold him in place.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Hopping up, I grab the nearest peach branch with both hands and hoist myself up.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">The kid stops trying to get away from Jeff. &ldquo;Watch out for my rooster, mister,&rdquo; he calls, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s especially mean&rdquo;.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Jeff releases the boy, who stands calmly looking up at me now.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">And then the chickens flock at me, their talons and beaks ripping through my clothes and picking at my skin.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;Sharp jabs come from everywhere, but I grit my teeth and keep climbing.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">I climb to the top of that dang tree and I actually make it within reaching distance of the peach, but as my fingers close around the supple, velvety fruit, I hear a crack and the beaks and talons are replaced by branches lashing against my face and bruising my body as I fall, shrieking and flailing into the pile of leaves.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><strong>2042-08-31T07:58:1900Z|b54ba8fb-01fa-496e-b97c-e3aaef3fb11a|&lsquo;...&rsquo;</strong><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">When I blink awake I can see stars twinkling through the debris covering my face. Twigs and leaves slide off of me as I sit up, peering around the dark quiet sunflower farm.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">It&rsquo;s absolutely silent.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Jeff is gone. The boy is gone and thank God, the chicken&rsquo;s are gone.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;I wiggle my fingers, scanning the branches of the moonlit tree and realize that stupid dang peach is gone too.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">My right forearm feels stiff and has a horrible throbbing ache. Grabbing at it with my left hand I feel cold metal. I stare, shocked at an electronic device that has been somehow clamped to my arm.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; I scream into the darkness. &ldquo;Who did this?</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Frantically I pry against it, but it doesn&rsquo;t budge. It&rsquo;s a single seamless piece of steel &ndash; except for some grooves at the top center of my arm.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Rummaging in my pocket I pull out my cell phone and shake it to activate the flashlight.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Two buttons are set flush in the steel arm cuff. One is metallic red and the other green.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Without thinking. I press the green button.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">There's a blinding flash of light and as my vision returns, five white hearts, a blue bar, and a map of a dark square with a green dot in the center are etched across my field of view.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">I hear a pop like someone pricked a balloon and the phone in my hand and the clothes on my back vaporize while, link by tiny link, chains form and stitch together around my body, a thousand per second until a knee-length </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hauberk"><span style="font-weight: 300;">Hauberk</span></a><span style="font-weight: 300;"> envelops me.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Looking down, I admire the spontaneously formed chainmail and chortle as I notice a neon yellow and white checkered fanny pack belted around my waist. The buttons on my arm cuff have disappeared.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Someone help me!&rdquo; My&nbsp; ears perk to the sound of Luke screaming somewhere in the sunflower field.</span><span style="font-weight: 300;"><br /></span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Luke I&rsquo;m coming!&rdquo; I dart towards the sea of flowers. &ldquo;Where are you?&rdquo; I tear through flower stalks, noticing that the green dot on the map is approaching a white circle with each step I take.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Luke continues to scream and I frantically stumble towards the intensifying sound of his voice until I burst into a perfectly circular clearing.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Squinting against the darkness I see the giant figure of a rooster silhouetted in the moonlight.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">The round clearing lights up as if pole-less stadium lights have been turned on overhead and I gasp.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Pinched in the rooster&rsquo;s beak, suspended two stories in the air by the collar of his t-shirt, is the squirming, bawling figure of the bedraggled boy. There&rsquo;s also something clenched in the rooster's left Talon.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">I gasp again.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">It&rsquo;s Jeff.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">A fight bell digs from the heavens, a red bar appears over the chicken&rsquo;s head, and he kicks his left talon forward, launching Jeff straight at me.</span><span style="font-weight: 300;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 300;">I immediately jump and find myself sailing up fifteen feet in the air as Jeff&rsquo;s lame body slides to a stop at the edge of the sunflower clearing.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Landing with a thud, I turn towards Jeff&rsquo;s crumpled body. A single white heart appears above his head.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Oh good I think that means he&rsquo;s alive.&rdquo;&nbsp; I let out a sigh of relief, but my reprieve is momentary.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">The rooster flings the child to the edge of the clearing opposite Jeff.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Half of one heart appears over the boy.</span></p>
                <p><em><span style="font-weight: 300;">I want to wake up. </span></em><span style="font-weight: 300;">I slap myself.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">Nothing happens.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; I scream, frustratedly punching at the air in the direction of the rooster.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">As I throw my fist forward, a mechanical hum issues from my arm cuff and some sort of cannon emerges.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">*Whoosh* a dang fireball shoots out of the cannon hitting the rooster&rsquo;s giant black comb which wobbles and quivers like a side of beef.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">My blue bar decreases slightly.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">The rooster&rsquo;s red bar remains full.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">It&rsquo;s insane and I&rsquo;m probably dreaming, but I proceed to duck and weave, dodging the black beak, with perfect ease while firing my cyborg fireball arm cuff thing with dead-on aim.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">I glance at the bar above the rooster&rsquo;s head as I nail him in the eye with a fireball. The red bar remains full.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">I nail him in his open beak.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;Still no change in the red bar.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">The red bar remains the same no matter How. Many. Perfect. Dang. Fireballs. I slam. Into. this giant black rooster.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">The bedraggled child is now stirring and showing a full white heart above his head.</span></p>
                <p><em><span style="font-weight: 300;">That&rsquo;s good. It looks like health regenerates.</span></em></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">My blue bar, which had been fully depleted ticks up slightly.</span></p>
                <p><em><span style="font-weight: 300;">Oh good! Magic regenerates!</span></em></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">SMMAAaaacCCKK</span><span style="font-weight: 300;"><br /></span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">The rooster&rsquo;s beak drills me into the ground.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Three of my five hearts disappear.</span><span style="font-weight: 300;"><br /></span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">Jumping to my feet, I run towards the sunflowers to hide, but as I reach the precipice of the field,,my whole body slams into an invisible wall.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Literal white stars circle above my head as I hear a faint voice beside me plead: &ldquo;your peach.&rdquo; The strange child is pointing at my crotch.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">I gawk at the child</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;The peach.&rdquo; He points at my crotch &ldquo;The peach is in your pouch!&rdquo; </span><span style="font-weight: 300;"><br /></span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">I unzip my fanny pack.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">The world goes silent and black.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Then white text appears:</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;"><br /></span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">INVENTORY:&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Peaches: 1</span></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;</span><em><span style="font-weight: 300;">Give a command</span></em><span style="font-weight: 300;">&rdquo; a robotic voice prompts me. &ldquo;</span><em><span style="font-weight: 300;">Some examples of commands are &lsquo;exit menu&rsquo;, or&nbsp; &lsquo;equip&rsquo;, &lsquo;unequip&rsquo; and &lsquo;drop&rsquo; followed by an inventory item</span></em><span style="font-weight: 300;">&rdquo;.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Equip Peach.&rdquo; I shout into the void.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Peach equipped&rdquo; the bot says.</span><span style="font-weight: 300;"><br /></span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">Nothing happens.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Exit Menu!&rdquo; I shout.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">I&rsquo;m immediately back in the clearing facing the black rooster, his beak agape.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Eat Peach you evil bird!&rdquo; I air punch towards the Rooster and a peach catapults from my arm cannon towards the bird monster&rsquo;s open maw.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">The rooster&rsquo;s mandibles clamp shut as the peach smacks into the back of his throat.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&nbsp;Cherry slot-machine-payout-sounds echo all around and cartoon peaches appear where the roosters' eyes had been.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">The red bar above his head turns green and the rooster juts out his left talon, grabbing up the bedraggled child and tossing him into the air.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">The child somersaults backwards landing perfectly astride the rooster&rsquo;s back as the rooster struts happily around the clearing.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">&ldquo;Thanks for helping me with my rooster&rdquo; the boy calls down from the chicken&rsquo;s back as he tosses a golden egg to me.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">I feel the egg slap my palm, but as I peer down, the egg disappears and a robotic voice coos in my ear. &ldquo;Congratulations Diego, you acquired a new fighting fellow.&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">When I look up, the boy and the rooster are a blur of motion, smashing a path through the sunflower field as they disappear into the darkness.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">As I stare down the trail of snapped sunflower stalks, my peripheral vision catches Jeff shakily rising to his feet 25 steps away from me.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">He has a cuff on his arm too.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">He&rsquo;s staring at something on the back of it.&nbsp;</span></p>
