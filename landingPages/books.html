                <p class="large text-muted">
                    Fremont, California. A group of strangers, drawn together by a curious online invitation and a longing for fellowship, find themselves sharing a meal in the front yard of a charmingly odd hobby chef and gardener named Jeff.
                    Little does each know, as they settle around Jeff’s picnic table for a bowl of “odd-ball soup”, that this seemingly quiet supper club will serve as their gateway to a mysterious reality bending adventure inside Hyperspear.
                    As our narrators travel beyond the borders of their humble hometown, they are forced to embark on a tumultuous odyssey through a kaleidoscope of wonderlands – where they must battle mystical creatures, unravel hidden secrets, and grapple with the unsettling nature of reality itself.
                    Settle in, tuck your napkin, and enjoy every humor-packed, soul-searching bite of Hyperspear.

Her quest to define and obtain fulfillment lead her to explore new living situations, dip a toe in the Internet dating scene, battle blood-sucking insects and confront life’s irksome questions: What is a meaningful existence? When is the right time to walk away from love? are cold sores really that bad?</p>
