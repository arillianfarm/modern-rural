                       Welcome friend, if you’re into farmy, DIY, quirkiness, then you are in the right spot.

                        Arillian Farm is the (self-labeled) micro-farm in our backyard… which is to say, we have a bunch of raised garden beds, a small flock of chickens, a couple wethered goats, three dogs and a lil pond with a few hundred mosquito fish on a little more than a quarter of an acre in Mesa, AZ.

                        When it’s too hot to tinker around outdoors, I spend a lot of time writing humorous and/or thought-provoking <a href="#!books">books</a> , <a href="#!comics">comics</a> and <a href="#!blog">blog entries</a>. Recently, I also started cataloging my favorite farm fresh (or at least not highly processed)

                        Arthur is my hightech, hottie, handyman, hero. He’s an electrical engineer and he loves to “work on things” –especially cars, audio and lighting and especially audio and lighting for cars.

                        Sometimes Arthur and I work on <a href="#!DIYing">DIY projects</a>  together - Like transforming a tough shed into a divided goat and chicken barn, building a catio at my rental property in Tempe, or making a little fish pond / chicken wading pool for our chickens.
